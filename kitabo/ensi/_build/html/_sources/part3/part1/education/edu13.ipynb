    "- **Ethical, Legal, and Social Aspects (ELSA) in Europe and Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) in the U.S.**\n",
    "- Notion of ELSI conceived during Human Genome Project\n",
    "- Topics vary with AI's maturity and the industry in question.\n",

    "### Key Speakers from Hopkins\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kadija Ferryman**: Anthropology & AI in healthcare, Guardrails in AI\n",
    "AI bias as a justice issue: algorithmic bias as a socio-tech issue (humans involved in **process**)\n",
    "   - data are imprinted with human biases\n",
    "   - a tool may perpetrate and exacerbate biases seen in humans\n",
    "   - so no such thing as pure \"objective\" AI\n",
    "   - privacy and security issues: AI works on a shit load of trained data\n",
    "   - introduces so many risks \n",
    "   - privacy and equity issues can have overlap (non-equal distribution of resources to \"keep data private\")\n",
    "   - bias-justice-privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Suchi Saria**: Standford, Machine learning, Bayesian health, [EMR+AI](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu)\n",
    "AI in 2023\n",
    "- Small groups very focused on specific problems can beat big tech (e.g. Suchi Saria)\n",
    "- practical AI (deeper learning around 2012: computer imaging, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc.)\n",
    "   - its an adult\n",
    "- generative AI (2014: GANs, creating new data similar to training data)\n",
    "   - rich output\n",
    "   - but needs rich output\n",
    "   - very unreliable\n",
    "   - its a fourth greater \n",
    "   - needs some adult supervision (tinglong dai)\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between AI and **autonomy**?\n",
    "- AI is a tool, system, or process\n",
    "- When a system can make decisions on its own: autonomy\n",
    "- So AI is a tool to achieve autonomy\n",
    "- Gap: is application within exciting areas\n",
    "- Driving is a good example thats reaching maturity\n",
    "- The other concept is \"augmentation\": complementary strength to humans\n",
    "   - look at tons of human records without fatigue\n",
    "   - think of data 24/7; no need to sleep\n",
    "   - can process unstructured data (not just numerical data)\n",
    "   - build workflows that are more efficient; less prone to errors; more consistent\n",
    "   - superhero capes: harder, faster, stronger, better, etc. for professionals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No chance that we can compete with big tech and lead the AI revolution\n",
    "2. Our role in AI in healthcare gives us a super-specific edge\n",
    "3. Bringing care closer to where patient lives\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Elliot Fishman**: Hopkins, Radiology, Pancreatic cancer, early detection using AI\n",
    "- Worked with Steve Jobs/Hopkins - radiology (Been at Hopkins for 40 years)\n",
    "- Pancreatic cancer: 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the US\n",
    "- But if you pickup tumors early, survival reaches 70%\n",
    "- Largest % present beyond this\n",
    "- Surgery, oncology, gi, radiology, and microsoct ai team at hopkins: early detection\n",
    "- Accuracy in determining what cystic lesions are cancerous\n",
    "- Moved on to other diagnoses (ICD-10 codes)\n",
    "   1. agent (rater)\n",
    "   2. verb (diagnosis)\n",
    "   3. object (patients)\n",
    "     - 1.5 million patients\n",
    "\n",
    "Worry about lossing jobs to AI?\n",
    "- For physicians who do not use AI, you'll be replaced; since its a supplement to your work\n",
    "- Average clinicians can be made into super clinicians; so Hopkins in a small town, small country, etc.\n",
    "- Program can now look at 1000s of images with accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    " More **interactivity** in education (think chatGPT)\n",
    "   - no medical student wants a lecture (none can listen for >45min)\n",
    "   - memorizing facts (AI can do a lot better)\n",
    "   - so we must rework this\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tinglong Dai**: Carnegie, Business aspects, AI in healthcare\n",

    "### Types of AI - Tinglong Dai\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practical AI**: Matured around 2012 (e.g., computer imaging, NLP)\n",
    "- **Generative AI**: Emerged around 2014 (e.g., GANs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference between AI and Autonomy - Tinglong Dai/Github Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI**: Tool, system, or process\n",
    "- **Autonomy**: System can make independent decisions\n",
    "- **Gap**: Application within exciting areas like driving\n",
    "\n",
    "### Augmentation vs. Replacement - Tinglong Dai\n",
    "\n",
    "- AI can augment human capabilities.\n",
    "- Risk of job loss for professionals not adopting AI.\n",

    "## Concerns and Challenges - Kadija Ferryman\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI Bias**: Justice issue, human biases can get imprinted\n",
    "- **Privacy and Security Risks**: AI needs vast data to learn and these data can be sensitive\n",
    "- **Interactivity in Education**: Need to reconsider traditional methods\n",
