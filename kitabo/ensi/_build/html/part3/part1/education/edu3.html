cnabongo: Hello.

00:00:01.860 --&gt; 00:00:04.769
Abimereki Muzaale: okay, so I&#39;m going to close everything.

3
00:00:05.110 --&gt; 00:00:08.649
cnabongo: So that we go back to scratch.

4
00:00:09.310 --&gt; 00:00:13.770
cnabongo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I need to do that. Because I really 1, 2.

5
00:00:14.960 --&gt; 00:00:20.170
Abimereki Muzaale: So let&#39;s just make sure you don&#39;t miss anything. We have talked about

6
00:00:20.460 --&gt; 00:00:33.890
Abimereki Muzaale: Github account.

7
00:00:33.950 --&gt; 00:00:58.960
Abimereki Muzaale: So Google is the important one initially. Yes. So so I&#39;ve got to Google. I&#39;ve just typed Github to give me the address later. You know the address you you need to go to Google. So let&#39;s build from here. So I&#39;m going there.

8
00:00:59.260 --&gt; 00:01:05.510
Abimereki Muzaale: And it&#39;s log meeting automatically, because I&#39;m an account. So you&#39;ll just have to create your account using

9
00:01:05.560 --&gt; 00:01:14.099
Abimereki Muzaale: one of your emails. Personal walk whatever you choose. So they create a ripple.

10
00:01:14.470 --&gt; 00:01:20.109
Abimereki Muzaale: a repository plus the top right corner. There&#39;ll be a plus.

37
00:05:49.530 --&gt; 00:05:58.040

Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So I use this

48
00:06:47.970 --&gt; 00:06:54.169
Abimereki Muzaale: to to create the code. So just copy and paste it. And and that&#39;s the content. Here

49
00:06:54.410 --&gt; 00:07:05.239
Abimereki Muzaale: is the web site. That&#39;s the content here. So this. So this is an invitation. You know, I get emails from high school students in Florida. If I click here

50
00:07:05.360 --&gt; 00:07:22.689
Abimereki Muzaale: this student from Florida, I&#39;m like, what am I going to? How am I going to mentor high school student. But but ask medical students of medical students. Even this medical student is in New York. He was at Princeton when I met when he met me during lockdown. Now he&#39;s in medical school

51
00:07:22.800 --&gt; 00:07:36.810
Abimereki Muzaale: so, plus, you know. My, so fuck out. See this out in my division of transplant side. Or this is me, I can click that. This is my project. So if I click on those, those will take me to other accounts. Yeah.

52
00:07:36.930 --&gt; 00:07:45.610
Abimereki Muzaale: so my wallet is here. It&#39;s not in my computer. Yeah. So all this. So this is content. So this basically a website, this is a book.

53
00:07:45.700 --&gt; 00:07:58.550
Abimereki Muzaale: so I can share this within you, and I just give them the URL. But this is a book does So you can. You can. You can. You can. You can click here, save, you know.

54
00:07:58.620 --&gt; 00:08:22.469
Abimereki Muzaale: This is so we here excited to introduce fit. Now a revolutionary platform. This is language from. I put some stuff that it edited. Look at what we&#39;re talking about use pre-rendered HTML Cs to ensure that websites perform exceptional speed. Blah, blah, blah blah. So you know.

55
00:08:22.660 --&gt; 00:08:49.269
Abimereki Muzaale: and let me get off topic. Let&#39;s get back to. I just wanted to show off that this is an example using using the account. And then we indicated

56
00:08:49.610 --&gt; 00:09:03.380
cnabongo: different deployments, different projects that one is handling. Yes, yes, so. But but this particular one is not yet?

57
00:09:22.280 --&gt; 00:09:26.569
Abimereki Muzaale: connected to the chat. Gp, because you&#39;re interested in content.

58
00:09:26.630 --&gt; 00:09:32.619
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, yeah, so what&#39;s the platform? So you first want to platform like, now, we have a website.

59
00:09:32.770 --&gt; 00:09:37.129
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, yeah, we didn&#39;t. We didn&#39;t go through the process of creating website. So I&#39;m gonna create a new ripple

60
00:09:37.250 --&gt; 00:09:44.750
Abimereki Muzaale: called Demo 2. I yeah. So request 3. Remember, I went to plus so demo 2.

61
00:09:45.660 --&gt; 00:09:50.700
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So so so so

62
00:09:50.860 --&gt; 00:09:54.150
cnabongo: if you said, you create different websites within.

63
00:09:55.050 --&gt; 00:09:58.130
Abimereki Muzaale: So you cannot one website per repository.

64
00:09:58.880 --&gt; 00:10:02.299
cnabongo: So you see, if I put Demo saying, Oh, this already exists.

65
00:10:02.370 --&gt; 00:10:07.349
Abimereki Muzaale: cause we created it. But we didn&#39;t record when I created the account. That is one.

66
00:10:07.380 --&gt; 00:10:15.010
cnabongo: So when you create, that is nothing, it&#39;s blank. There&#39;s no repository. Just a blank page.

67
00:10:15.280 --&gt; 00:10:24.109
Abimereki Muzaale: You create your first repository because everything is going to be tracked in the context of a repository, not the account.

68
00:10:24.130 --&gt; 00:10:25.810
cnabongo: The cart is just African.

69
00:10:25.870 --&gt; 00:10:28.289
Abimereki Muzaale: The one Senior Repository will be.

70
00:10:28.530 --&gt; 00:10:33.330
cnabongo: yeah. So the repository to website?

71
00:10:33.610 --&gt; 00:10:36.429
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, no, no website. It&#39;s just a tiny

72
00:10:36.740 --&gt; 00:10:43.389
Abimereki Muzaale: part of the product of a repository. Repository is gonna be literally files. But you can track

73
00:10:43.460 --&gt; 00:11:11.310
Abimereki Muzaale: profiles and documents. The URL is just a one product. Some people may not be interested in the URL because they&#39;re doing work in secret things. Yeah, but you can have a repository. Yeah. But if you had to share you will need a page. A URL, yeah. So so now put to here, cause it&#39;s not gonna allow this, because it already exists, so I could delete the other one.

74
00:11:11.410 --&gt; 00:11:13.489
Abimereki Muzaale: But for now II won&#39;t delete.

75
00:11:13.520 --&gt; 00:11:16.130
Abimereki Muzaale: This is available public.

76
00:11:16.140 --&gt; 00:11:20.619
Abimereki Muzaale: you know. If you had to be private. You can&#39;t create a URL or top secret things

77
00:11:21.210 --&gt; 00:11:23.159
create repository.

78
00:11:23.800 --&gt; 00:11:28.240
Abimereki Muzaale: So now we not create an account how to create a repository

79
00:11:28.320 --&gt; 00:11:33.189
Abimereki Muzaale: so that that would be the URL, the link to the repository.

80
00:11:33.450 --&gt; 00:11:36.740
Abimereki Muzaale: But to activate it, you need to create what?

81
00:11:37.070 --&gt; 00:11:39.790
Abimereki Muzaale: Add any document to it. Yeah.

82
00:11:40.060 --&gt; 00:11:42.899
cnabongo: So let me just

83
00:11:42.970 --&gt; 00:11:52.989
Abimereki Muzaale: say my main. What my main word at this point is, if I&#39;m trying to write my stuff, I don&#39;t want it to be public. Huh? That&#39;s a good point. So I can tell you that.

84
00:11:54.240 --&gt; 00:11:59.299
Abimereki Muzaale: because of the convenience of II have in

85
00:11:59.680 --&gt; 00:12:01.080
Abimereki Muzaale: in

86
00:12:01.740 --&gt; 00:12:10.859
Abimereki Muzaale: in, in in something which is public. Yeah, what I&#39;ve been doing is creating these books. Yeah, with a blank. If someone finds this

87
00:12:11.610 --&gt; 00:12:28.319
Abimereki Muzaale: something under Part 5, I know under part 5 towards the end. I know there&#39;s something here.

88
00:12:28.320 --&gt; 00:12:42.920
Abimereki Muzaale: Click there, I know. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing for now so that it&#39;s public. But if someone in the world is gonna be looking for this. But if someone phone this URL, for some reason.

89
00:12:43.120 --&gt; 00:13:08.080
Abimereki Muzaale: you know, depending on how popular you are, people might be just in interested in you, item by item, so many students. They will definitely

90
00:13:08.080 --&gt; 00:13:13.619
cnabongo: wanted to check out every

91
00:13:13.650 --&gt; 00:13:24.719
Abimereki Muzaale: for my accounts. So anyway. So so we we&#39;ll get to that. Let&#39;s first get back to the basic of creating something black

92
00:13:24.850 --&gt; 00:13:34.909
Abimereki Muzaale: so here we, this will be the URL. But we need to create a file past. Yeah. So for this to be activated.

93
00:13:35.100 --&gt; 00:13:38.799
Abimereki Muzaale: there has to be some content. So I click, I click on that.

94
00:13:39.540 --&gt; 00:13:52.419
Abimereki Muzaale: Say, your file name. So the file name we&#39;re going to choose is index. III it&#39;s just the standard one index dot. HTML, we&#39;re moving her for Powerpoint and Doc. X. HTML commits.

95
00:13:52.740 --&gt; 00:14:02.529
Abimereki Muzaale: This is for record for fascia and control you&#39;d be able to track versions of this record of this file. And this, you know. So this is my first commit.

96
00:14:03.620 --&gt; 00:14:06.860
Abimereki Muzaale:  it&#39;s a commit.

97
00:14:06.890 --&gt; 00:14:10.020
cnabongo: Did you say you&#39;re also recording video? Right?

98
00:14:10.080 --&gt; 00:14:16.729
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, this is being recorded. Yes, I can&#39;t confirm just a second. Let&#39;s see, hey?

99
00:14:17.320 --&gt; 00:14:19.550
Abimereki Muzaale: It is recording. It&#39;s recording. Yes.

100
00:14:19.790 --&gt; 00:14:20.610
cnabongo: Okay.

101
00:14:21.940 --&gt; 00:14:28.590
Abimereki Muzaale: okay. So it&#39;s giving me an error. Go to default branch go to Default Branch.

102
00:14:30.680 --&gt; 00:14:35.589
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, I didn&#39;t know I&#39;d give me that era. So I&#39;ve created this. Yeah.

103
00:14:36.130 --&gt; 00:14:49.460
Abimereki Muzaale: II. So now my URL is active. My account is active. Demo 2. Now I&#39;m going to click here so that I go to the landing page

104
00:14:50.440 --&gt; 00:15:01.129
Abimereki Muzaale: landing page of my repository. Yeah, if I click on this to show all my repositories. But this is specific repository of, you see, only one document.

105
00:15:01.390 --&gt; 00:15:07.340
Abimereki Muzaale: you know. So what I want for yeah, URL, on the right margin. We need to have a

106
00:15:07.390 --&gt; 00:15:09.940
Abimereki Muzaale: a Github page.

107
00:15:10.010 --&gt; 00:15:23.890
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s where things go public. Yeah. And I may have to go to settings to activate that. So then, good settings. So setting this here and a demo, I&#39;m going to settings.

108
00:15:25.090 --&gt; 00:15:29.580
Abimereki Muzaale: I need to activate you. Tab pages to the left margin.

109
00:15:30.830 --&gt; 00:15:32.469
Abimereki Muzaale: You&#39;d have edges

110
00:15:33.300 --&gt; 00:15:34.650
Abimereki Muzaale: now.

111
00:15:35.500 --&gt; 00:15:44.519
Abimereki Muzaale: Branch, I think it&#39;s called a branch. so so that the main is where we&#39;re from. Now. I&#39;m going to suggest

112
00:15:44.850 --&gt; 00:15:48.819
Abimereki Muzaale: dash pages. It&#39;s usually supposed to appear there.

113
00:15:52.160 --&gt; 00:16:00.360
Abimereki Muzaale: I I was impatient last time, but let me go back and see if it&#39;s going to appear.

114
00:16:00.840 --&gt; 00:16:08.359
Abimereki Muzaale: The bus stop here somewhere here the Github pages where we&#39;ll deploy. Context.

115
00:16:10.220 --&gt; 00:16:12.990
Give it 30 s or so.

116
00:16:13.730 --&gt; 00:16:21.600
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, so so HTML is for structure. Then the dot Css is for color

117
00:16:22.080 --&gt; 00:16:32.150
Abimereki Muzaale: and and Javascript is for images. And so this is 3 elements that you indicate to 3 elements. Yes.

118
00:16:33.250 --&gt; 00:16:36.810
Abimereki Muzaale: I feel like there&#39;s something that I still haven&#39;t done.

119
00:16:36.990 --&gt; 00:16:38.820
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s not activating

120
00:16:41.590 --&gt; 00:16:43.390
Abimereki Muzaale: few branches.

121
00:16:50.080 --&gt; 00:17:02.860
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. The experience, I can assure you, is much easier within your account. Yeah, let me. I&#39;ve gone back to settings.

122
00:17:03.310 --&gt; 00:17:13.999
Abimereki Muzaale: A hedges deploy github actions. You play brunch noise

123
00:17:14.569 --&gt; 00:17:16.390
Abimereki Muzaale: github edges.

124
00:17:16.460 --&gt; 00:17:20.490
Abimereki Muzaale: I don&#39;t know why this is not supposed to appear. Yeah.

125
00:17:23.869 --&gt; 00:17:29.100
cnabongo:  let&#39;s do.

126
00:17:30.110 --&gt; 00:17:32.930

00:23:49.810 --&gt; 00:24:19.760
Abimereki Muzaale: your hello world with some basic Css, nice giving. You quote. Do you understand that code? Do I understand that? Quote? Just be like a child, and don&#39;t be intimidated. Just copy and business. Yeah, it&#39;s quite intimidating. Yeah, just just don&#39;t be intimidated. Copy. If you can copy, if you can. Just remember that the chat copies I I&#39;ve seen a dust, and there was that does love this enough. They understand nothing.

185
00:24:19.760 --&gt; 00:24:24.540
Abimereki Muzaale: They don&#39;t ask what they talking about. No.

186
00:24:24.600 --&gt; 00:24:26.220
Abimereki Muzaale: so I&#39;m going to copy

187
00:24:27.010 --&gt; 00:24:48.489
cnabongo: language, even if you can speak like I can see Russian. And so this is Russian.

188
00:24:48.600 --&gt; 00:25:05.950
Abimereki Muzaale: I can say this is Japanese, even if I don&#39;t understand. So I at this point I can say, this is HTML but oh, this is a few years. HTML, so I&#39;m gonna copy and put this analogy. All those little things there that I can see, and probably one kind of like Bug Brown, I can you edit to those

189
00:25:05.950 --&gt; 00:25:30.740
cnabongo: justify

190
00:25:30.740 --&gt; 00:25:48.489
Abimereki Muzaale: at this point I&#39;ve dumped in my content, for example, so that content, you see where the content falls in. So let&#39;s just edit this first and just remove this. Hello! Let&#39;s first see what giving us, because we we didn&#39;t have any content. Look at where? Hello! All this here.

191
00:25:48.750 --&gt; 00:25:53.010
Abimereki Muzaale: use it. So all of this is just editing. Can you imagine?

192
00:25:53.370 --&gt; 00:26:02.000
Abimereki Muzaale: Hello! All this right there? Yeah. So any, let&#39;s let&#39;s commit changes. Let&#39;s say, commit message for the

193
00:26:02.030 --&gt; 00:26:05.470
Abimereki Muzaale: the purpose of history was said, first

197
00:26:19.040 --&gt; 00:26:25.580
Abimereki Muzaale: Colin. Maybe staling. I think Cola is just one aspect of the staling. So I&#39;m gonna go back here

198
00:26:26.500 --&gt; 00:26:34.289
Abimereki Muzaale: and we&#39;re going to have to wait. You can see our last update is 6 min ago. So I&#39;m going to refresh this, and we wait around 30 s to 1 min

199
00:26:34.710 --&gt; 00:26:43.760
Abimereki Muzaale: and and so, as you can see, this is a workflow that you have to stop. If you&#39;re like, Okay, share. Gpt is where I get code from.

200
00:26:44.010 --&gt; 00:26:58.199
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, where you get language from. So whether it&#39;s English or call. Yeah, and the code would be HTML could be python. So far we&#39;ve seen python and HTML in this recording. We haven&#39;t seen the python yet. Only the HTML,

201
00:26:58.360 --&gt; 00:27:08.090
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. And and then I have my HTML file here, and I&#39;m coping straight from to here. Let me refresh this and see if it&#39;s ready

204
00:27:26.420 --&gt; 00:27:30.010
Abimereki Muzaale: So let&#39;s see, it&#39;s very fresh.

00:27:30.070 --&gt; 00:27:32.679
cnabongo: Yeah, it&#39;s green, it&#39;s green. It&#39;s ready.

00:27:43.110 --&gt; 00:27:55.189
Abimereki Muzaale:  look at this. So well, elevated that website to something something better. Yeah. So so now we have

Where is that in the HTML file? So this all. So let&#39;s introduce some towns. So this, let&#39;s close this.

211
00:28:20.990 --&gt; 00:28:39.350
Abimereki Muzaale: Let&#39;s close. So this is called the front end, that that&#39;s a well, the language in the computer while it, while so this is what people see. It&#39;s called the front end. This is the back end. Yeah, this is this is the back end. So we&#39;ll go back the back end. Let&#39;s click on. HTML.

212
00:28:39.510 --&gt; 00:28:50.949
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, oh, no! The pencil. Pick up the pencil here. So it looks like there&#39;s more content than Hello, World. Oh, welcome to my world website. So I could say.

213
00:28:51.580 --&gt; 00:28:52.690
Abimereki Muzaale: welcome

214
00:28:53.020 --&gt; 00:28:56.289
Abimereki Muzaale: to my autobiography.

215
00:28:57.830 --&gt; 00:28:58.730
Abimereki Muzaale: Huh!

216
00:29:01.040 --&gt; 00:29:03.630
Abimereki Muzaale: Welcome to the space.

217
00:29:04.300 --&gt; 00:29:10.589
Abimereki Muzaale: The spicy, I don&#39;t know is building a spiciest or topography. Huh! And

218
00:29:10.750 --&gt; 00:29:12.670
Abimereki Muzaale: is there could be changes.

219
00:29:12.890 --&gt; 00:29:17.630
Abimereki Muzaale:  I can say I&#39;ve edited

220
00:29:17.680 --&gt; 00:29:22.890
Abimereki Muzaale: the welcome pitch. Yeah. And I commit that change.

221
00:29:23.150 --&gt; 00:29:38.970
Abimereki Muzaale: So at least now I&#39;ve done about 4 commitments, and so we have good in a sense of that workflow. Yeah. And as to the quality of the website this is my first time actually to work directly on on stuff. I&#39;ve been using an existing

222
00:29:39.060 --&gt; 00:29:52.580
Abimereki Muzaale: a cord already that exists and modified it. But actually, you don&#39;t need anymore. With that Gp, no knowledge at all, we don&#39;t need that anymore. Yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s very important. 0 knowledge. So refresh. And

223
00:29:52.580 --&gt; 00:30:09.750
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, yeah, yeah, so it&#39;s not yet ready, I think. Typically, at least with my Internet speed, that it&#39;s seconds 1 min, really more. Unless your update was so massive. If it&#39;s massive, it could take up 5 min update. But this is not massive.

224
00:30:10.270 --&gt; 00:30:14.609
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, there we are. So it&#39;s 30 s to a minute. Is my estimation.

225
00:30:15.060 --&gt; 00:30:30.569
Abimereki Muzaale:  it&#39;s really exciting. This stuff is for me. Now I understand when you are saying that you know this can make you extremely productive. I think once you have, once, once you have the humb of it.

226
00:30:30.600 --&gt; 00:30:38.630
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, the yes, the this is ready.

227
00:30:38.810 --&gt; 00:30:48.030
Abimereki Muzaale: So now I&#39;m gonna go back to the front end and see what we edited. You see? Oh, no, no, that&#39;s not new. I need to refresh. refresh.

228
00:30:49.130 --&gt; 00:30:54.500
cnabongo: Welcome to the spiciest of. So this is just a title.

229
00:30:54.520 --&gt; 00:31:07.860
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, you cannot go down to content cause I can go to, so I can edit directly. But if I&#39;m lazy I can just copy and paste this back to Chat Gbt.

230
00:31:07.950 --&gt; 00:31:09.110
Abimereki Muzaale: and say.

231
00:31:09.200 --&gt; 00:31:12.380
Abimereki Muzaale: so. Gpg, back here. I&#39;m like, Okay.

232
00:31:13.050 --&gt; 00:31:19.180
Abimereki Muzaale: this is great. Now, could you include

233
00:31:20.200 --&gt; 00:31:25.810
Abimereki Muzaale: there table of contents? Just make up stuff

234
00:31:28.790 --&gt; 00:31:33.230
Abimereki Muzaale: it, template for me to later edit

235
00:31:33.670 --&gt; 00:31:50.060
Abimereki Muzaale: so, for you could go there and edit insight for me. I&#39;m too lazy, I&#39;m like after I Gp, so let it let let it do everything it&#39;s gonna give us a table content. That would be high level.

236
00:32:07.080 --&gt; 00:32:15.099
Abimereki Muzaale: So the Internet website structure is designed by HTML, then all the details as you&#39;re going to see of color.

237
00:32:15.110 --&gt; 00:32:23.499
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s Css, then, images. That&#39;s Jo Javan. You&#39;ll see how. So the quote from Css. Would be put inside this HTML.

238
00:32:23.500 --&gt; 00:32:50.119
Abimereki Muzaale: Then the Code Javascript Javascript gives me quote, I&#39;m like, where do I put it? Oh, put it inside the HTML, so let me copy and paste and see. What does that later, you be able to see. Understand exactly where the the things that you edit them directly. So

239
00:32:50.420 --&gt; 00:32:54.870
Abimereki Muzaale: Is the latest I&#39;ve edited, updated, commit message.

250
00:33:43.110 --&gt; 00:33:46.160
Abimereki Muzaale: I said, browse files

251
00:33:46.460 --&gt; 00:33:49.579
Abimereki Muzaale: a bet. and then I click on this.

252
00:33:51.590 --&gt; 00:33:53.450
Abimereki Muzaale: See? No content. Yeah.

253
00:33:53.670 --&gt; 00:33:56.500
Abimereki Muzaale: no content. Yeah.

254
00:33:56.710 --&gt; 00:33:59.769
Abimereki Muzaale: And if we go back to history.

255
00:34:01.420 --&gt; 00:34:05.899
Abimereki Muzaale: Well, that&#39;s a history. At the time of the first commit. So there&#39;s no history.

256
00:34:06.170 --&gt; 00:34:09.050
Abimereki Muzaale: So we have to move back to our landing page.

257
00:34:09.620 --&gt; 00:34:17.759
Abimereki Muzaale: and and click on the file and click on history up here. And so we can now go to, let&#39;s say.

258
00:34:18.100 --&gt; 00:34:24.520
Abimereki Muzaale: Before styling. We will introduce Styling, and you see, click on that. and then browse, file.

259
00:34:26.190 --&gt; 00:34:31.579
Abimereki Muzaale: and then click here to see its content. You can see just head. Hello, world, not HTML,

260
00:34:31.909 --&gt; 00:34:39.090
Abimereki Muzaale: so so that&#39;s a history. But any so let&#39;s see, this is ready for us to view.

261
00:34:39.130 --&gt; 00:34:45.689
Abimereki Muzaale: I catch one of our changes we made. Oh, web table content. Okay, this is refreshing.

262
00:34:45.840 --&gt; 00:34:56.720
cnabongo: Look at that. So so now, what I wanted to share here is that this the limit of a web page.

263
00:34:56.860 --&gt; 00:35:11.499
Abimereki Muzaale: so you can have everything on one page. That&#39;s fine. You can have continued down here with introduction and all that. Oh, it&#39;s even credit fake links. But for me, I&#39;d rather have it. Book. Huh! But for status a webpage is very good

264
00:35:11.610 --&gt; 00:35:18.740
Abimereki Muzaale: cause. It&#39;s been very easy to demonstrate. Do, can you do some? Cs, Csc, Css for cover?

265
00:35:18.830 --&gt; 00:35:24.919
Abimereki Muzaale: Henry, ask, you have time? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely too. Absolutely. Let&#39;s say, okay.

266
00:35:25.110 --&gt; 00:35:26.150
Abimereki Muzaale: okay.

267
00:35:26.280 --&gt; 00:35:28.430
Abimereki Muzaale: let&#39;s add some

268
00:35:28.640 --&gt; 00:35:36.639
Abimereki Muzaale: cop and my picture and a picture that&#39;s Java.

269
00:35:36.890 --&gt; 00:35:49.970
cnabongo: automatically. Huh!

270
00:35:50.030 --&gt; 00:35:59.729
Abimereki Muzaale: You don&#39;t need to go into some other complications. Not at all. So it&#39;s giving you notes there, I mean, I don&#39;t even read the notes. I&#39;m too lazy. Just copy a paste

271
00:35:59.810 --&gt; 00:36:17.259
Abimereki Muzaale: by by this time. You&#39;re saying it has already connected with the Chat. Gp. No, no, there&#39;s no connection. I I&#39;ve not know now you&#39;ve connected with the Chat Gp, whereas you already you already using it. No, I copied and pasted. I typed in here typed here.

272
00:36:17.490 --&gt; 00:36:19.200
Abimereki Muzaale: I made my requests here.

273
00:36:19.770 --&gt; 00:36:27.340
cnabongo: It remembers. When when when did you? When did? When did you chat, or when. So so after creating the website.

274
00:36:28.020 --&gt; 00:36:34.350
cnabongo: now, you oh, oh, so there&#39;s no connection between Chargt and Github. There&#39;s 0 connection.

275
00:36:34.720 --&gt; 00:36:40.050
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m just asking. I&#39;m getting code from Chat Gp coping and pasting it into Github.

276
00:36:40.750 --&gt; 00:36:46.660
Abimereki Muzaale: So there&#39;s no connection between these 2. This is my source of my content. Is jgb.

277
00:36:47.010 --&gt; 00:36:50.360
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, okay, it&#39;s the source of micro. It&#39;s guiding me.

278
00:36:50.540 --&gt; 00:37:00.989
Abimereki Muzaale: So I&#39;m saying, Okay, now, I need to add color. It&#39;s giving me code. I think, to what we already have. Look at how complex this is getting, and I understand nothing. but there&#39;s gonna be colors

279
00:37:01.170 --&gt; 00:37:17.209
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;m going to copy. But this is gonna be image. So we have to figure, I find an image doing so we&#39;ll find out where it&#39;s gonna look something like dot. Jpg, I&#39;ll look for that. So I&#39;m just copying here. This has no connection with Gtp, I mean, Github.

280
00:37:17.420 --&gt; 00:37:21.310
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s just giving me code, since I don&#39;t know any code.

281
00:37:21.320 --&gt; 00:37:24.709
cnabongo: But how did it. But how did it pick your?

282
00:37:24.850 --&gt; 00:37:32.190
cnabongo: Because it&#39;s my account? No, it has. How has it picked your content because

283
00:37:32.340 --&gt; 00:37:42.809
Abimereki Muzaale: it knows our conversation? So here this conversation. So it knows

284
00:37:42.860 --&gt; 00:37:58.610
Abimereki Muzaale: that II started with a file called Index HTML, which was blank and dial, and I asked it for HTML. It gave me. HTML, it gave me Css, so it knows these things. It knows me. Yes.

285
00:37:58.610 --&gt; 00:38:20.280
Abimereki Muzaale: so so now I&#39;m going to github. Yeah.

286
00:38:20.340 --&gt; 00:38:28.320
Abimereki Muzaale: Github has no knowledge of Trg at all. I&#39;m not just going here as if I&#39;m going to edit this myself.

287
00:38:28.710 --&gt; 00:38:35.580
Abimereki Muzaale: but instead of editing myself, I click on this to edit instead of editing, I&#39;m just going to copy and paste

288
00:38:36.520 --&gt; 00:38:38.290
Abimereki Muzaale: copying and pasting

289
00:38:38.310 --&gt; 00:38:43.410
Abimereki Muzaale: what? So I&#39;m copying. I&#39;m removing this and then pasting the Content.

290
00:38:43.460 --&gt; 00:38:52.830
Abimereki Muzaale: So this some Css. I don&#39;t know what Css. Looks like. Probably this is kind of things I don&#39;t know but I asked it for color.

291
00:38:53.070 --&gt; 00:39:05.060
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, I asked it for image. S. Do you see here? Jpeg, yeah. I would have to set an image here. So let me look for an image to set there, and you see it says, add image here.

292
00:39:06.120 --&gt; 00:39:11.240
Abimereki Muzaale: So how do I add? Oh, yes. So let&#39;s pass.

293
00:39:11.420 --&gt; 00:39:15.289
Abimereki Muzaale: Update this without adding an image. Then see what&#39;s going to happen? Yeah.

294
00:39:15.440 --&gt; 00:39:17.600
Abimereki Muzaale: it&#39;s because I think we asked for color.

295
00:39:17.930 --&gt; 00:39:21.260
Abimereki Muzaale: So I see color here. This is a color code.

296
00:39:21.510 --&gt; 00:39:36.870
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I don&#39;t know what color that is. But let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s first update this. Then figure out how to add an image. Let&#39;s do one thing at a time. So commit. I&#39;m going to say, I&#39;m adding, adding some color

297
00:39:38.720 --&gt; 00:39:41.189
Abimereki Muzaale: with that. Css.

298
00:39:43.650 --&gt; 00:39:47.710
Abimereki Muzaale: okay, so that&#39;s done. As we wait for that

299
00:39:48.100 --&gt; 00:40:02.800
Abimereki Muzaale: to update, I need to start thinking of an image from my computer. Which image, then, actually, you know, I didn&#39;t go to my computer, the Internet. Let me use the Internet. No, let me use the computer so that I demonstrate

300
00:40:03.000 --&gt; 00:40:06.930
Abimereki Muzaale: the process. Where can I find a picture

301
00:40:08.030 --&gt; 00:40:11.210
Abimereki Muzaale: picture picture picture picture

302
00:40:11.360 --&gt; 00:40:13.350
Abimereki Muzaale: pictures here

303
00:40:15.220 --&gt; 00:40:16.900
Abimereki Muzaale: and know that pictures?

304
00:40:17.570 --&gt; 00:40:22.270
Abimereki Muzaale: I have some pictures

305
00:40:22.860 --&gt; 00:40:23.580
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah.

306
00:40:25.470 --&gt; 00:40:29.500
Abimereki Muzaale: Had some pictures here. Oh, they&#39;re here. Jenner Weinde.

307
00:40:30.040 --&gt; 00:40:31.060
cnabongo: that.

308
00:40:31.680 --&gt; 00:40:33.590
Abimereki Muzaale: So okay.

309
00:40:33.620 --&gt; 00:40:38.440
Abimereki Muzaale: there&#39;s a Png, so let&#39;s get back to Github. So how do you?

310
00:40:38.450 --&gt; 00:40:47.549
Abimereki Muzaale: Upload a file? Add file here. just like we created this file. I said, Create, in this case we&#39;re not creating my uploading.

311
00:40:48.760 --&gt; 00:40:52.560
Abimereki Muzaale: So I&#39;m going to drag it says drag files here. So I&#39;m going to drag this

312
00:40:54.590 --&gt; 00:41:04.100
Abimereki Muzaale: is there? Commit? Yeah, yep, commit. So this helps. You see. Picture of general.

313
00:41:04.250 --&gt; 00:41:05.450
Abimereki Muzaale: you know

314
00:41:07.740 --&gt; 00:41:08.780
Abimereki Muzaale: it&#39;s it&#39;s

315
00:41:10.010 --&gt; 00:41:20.850
Abimereki Muzaale: I think we can add this picture to. So it&#39;s Generalwinda Png. We can go to HTML and add that there generally, and Dutch. P.

316
00:41:21.390 --&gt; 00:41:35.560
Abimereki Muzaale: It says. add image here. Here. general. a bit of it&#39;s here. general. hey? Oh, I need to edit

Abimereki Muzaale: edit.

318
00:41:38.560 --&gt; 00:41:40.499
Abimereki Muzaale: And it&#39;s yeah.

319
00:41:41.600 --&gt; 00:41:44.460
Abimereki Muzaale: General Pandisco Moinda.

320
00:41:45.140 --&gt; 00:41:49.780
Abimereki Muzaale: and it&#39;s not jpg, it&#39;s PNGP. NG.

321
00:41:50.620 --&gt; 00:41:57.399
Abimereki Muzaale: If that&#39;s it, I love table content colours. Yeah, this enough updates. So here I did

322
00:41:57.660 --&gt; 00:41:59.180
Abimereki Muzaale: added picture.

323
00:41:59.280 --&gt; 00:42:02.730
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, general way into

324
00:42:03.890 --&gt; 00:42:06.870
Abimereki Muzaale: to HTML,

325
00:42:10.410 --&gt; 00:42:11.210
Abimereki Muzaale: okay.

326
00:42:11.640 --&gt; 00:42:22.610
Abimereki Muzaale: we go back here and wait. This may take longer, maybe 1 min for now we can see the updates. We. We are working on Carla as we waited. As we wait for the feature.

327
00:42:23.090 --&gt; 00:42:25.910
Abimereki Muzaale: let&#39;s refresh and see.

328
00:42:26.170 --&gt; 00:42:29.880
Abimereki Muzaale: Color. So the background has blue. Yeah.

329
00:42:29.990 --&gt; 00:42:34.530
cnabongo: Oh, and the picture is going to be here

330
00:42:34.950 --&gt; 00:42:42.850
Abimereki Muzaale: to be at the top. Yeah.

331
00:42:44.830 --&gt; 00:42:46.559
Abimereki Muzaale: keep refreshing

332
00:42:47.830 --&gt; 00:42:50.870
Abimereki Muzaale: anytime. Now. It should.

333
00:42:51.960 --&gt; 00:43:07.020
Abimereki Muzaale: Takes 1 min. Shouldn&#39;t be more than 1 min. But yeah, so this is an example of website web page. Sorry we can discuss that later.

334
00:43:07.200 --&gt; 00:43:14.430
Abimereki Muzaale: For now. Oh, there it is. Oh, boy.

335
00:43:14.490 --&gt; 00:43:22.140
Abimereki Muzaale: I do not know. It&#39;s actually this is my first time ever to design a web page

336
00:43:22.420 --&gt; 00:43:24.459
Abimereki Muzaale: a hundred percent

337
00:43:24.750 --&gt; 00:43:36.570
Abimereki Muzaale: with information from just language using English. You can try and try using the soga you communicate with Soga, and it will work.

338
00:43:36.620 --&gt; 00:43:54.890
Abimereki Muzaale: Then it&#39;s me moving. Yeah.

339
00:43:54.990 --&gt; 00:44:02.139
Abimereki Muzaale: so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s you who will be navigating this? Just URL, just the Internet.

340
00:44:02.370 --&gt; 00:44:05.490
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So that&#39;s the general idea.

341
00:44:05.640 --&gt; 00:44:13.119
Abimereki Muzaale:  regarding regarding Github. Yeah.

342
00:44:13.390 --&gt; 00:44:20.599
Abimereki Muzaale: the the the other one that that shared a python. We can get that later, but you probably won&#39;t be using much python code

343
00:44:20.620 --&gt; 00:44:24.530
Abimereki Muzaale: for now, but if you want, they can be for the recording purposes if you want

344
00:44:24.850 --&gt; 00:44:26.770
cnabongo: important purposes.

345
00:44:26.810 --&gt; 00:44:43.059
Abimereki Muzaale: But I think let&#39;s stick to this for now, because you need to. Don&#39;t need much of that other code, for now you you have what you have seen, what you&#39;ve witnessed here is HTML,

346
00:44:43.170 --&gt; 00:44:45.730
cnabongo: let me close it. Too many tabs. Yes.

347
00:44:45.820 --&gt; 00:44:54.029
Abimereki Muzaale: Css, so the the Css. Is responsible for the color and the glossy, even the white glossy. That look

348
00:44:54.070 --&gt; 00:44:55.320
Abimereki Muzaale: is Css.

349
00:44:55.330 --&gt; 00:44:59.710
Abimereki Muzaale: the structure that&#39;s HTML and image.

350
00:44:59.820 --&gt; 00:45:02.290
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s Javascript.

351
00:45:02.690 --&gt; 00:45:07.459
Abimereki Muzaale: So one part of this quote are those things I don&#39;t know over time you can line.

352
00:45:07.680 --&gt; 00:45:21.090
Abimereki Muzaale: but I can tell you I think this is a great kind of get complicated with the python code. I know you can get more actually.

353
00:45:21.150 --&gt; 00:45:24.370
Abimereki Muzaale: There&#39;s another AI in Github by Microsoft.

354
00:45:24.550 --&gt; 00:45:26.400
Abimereki Muzaale: called copilot.

355
00:45:26.680 --&gt; 00:45:37.220
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, co-pilot, if you can. Let&#39;s let me see if we can access it. Just III pay $10 a month for that one.

356 
00:45:37.330 --&gt; 00:45:42.780
Abimereki Muzaale: So I&#39;m going to go to Github Develop here. let&#39;s see.

357
00:45:58.700 --&gt; 00:46:14.520
Abimereki Muzaale: No, I think maybe this may not be a good idea to introduce this. This may be too many things for status. This, I think let&#39;s stop here for now. I wanted to show you that I which allows you to complete code so what we&#39;re doing with giving us fully written code.

358
00:46:14.770 --&gt; 00:46:16.869
Abimereki Muzaale: But if you were writing code

359
00:46:16.960 --&gt; 00:46:25.740
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, the Microsoft copilot can complete auto completion. He&#39;s saying, oh, I can&#39;t figure out what you&#39;re trying to do. I just completes.

360
00:46:25.810 --&gt; 00:46:37.810
Abimereki Muzaale: you know. So so, but anyway, so I think this is for now this. Yeah. So I&#39;m gonna stop the recording so that it doesn&#39;t become too big. Then I will share

361
00:46:38.020 --&gt; 00:46:40.339
cnabongo: who is a recording? Yeah.

Center.

2
00:00:02.350 --&gt; 00:00:10.130
Abimereki Muzaale: This is, this is at the center of what we are handling now, because, you know, I mean education. The issue

3
00:00:10.480 --&gt; 00:00:15.759
cnabongo: is now in the with the onset of now. AI. Yes.

4
00:00:16.170 --&gt; 00:00:37.600
cnabongo: What exactly is the education? Because now and now they are like, it&#39;s a crisis, because you have kids simply jumping things and not doing, not learning basic. So so the the trick here is increasing the challenge. Of course it. It requires. It requires

5
00:00:37.610 --&gt; 00:01:05.019
cnabongo: again. Now, new capacities for lecturers and teachers, things at lower levels. But they need to rethink where where you had one simple complex, like the complex solutions you give the complex how should I say challenges you? Give students is at a lower level. Now you have to think complexity

6
00:01:05.120 --&gt; 00:01:34.050
Abimereki Muzaale: and then and then, so that you&#39;re able to test that higher level of skill, you know, under that means that we custom drop their game. That&#39;s a very good point. So, while even John&#39;s Hopkins has been discussing, oh, my goodness, what do you do? AI. For me? I&#39;ve been going ahead doing it. It is a challenge. It is a challenge about this 2 days, first, because the lecturer

7
00:01:34.410 --&gt; 00:01:37.979
cnabongo: now may be not very comfortable.

8
00:01:38.320 --&gt; 00:02:02.180
cnabongo: putting a higher level of complexity to the students, because they are still operating the old mode where they think students are using their head. But now they&#39;re having a tools and skills. Okay, that is the skills. But that&#39;s why I told you for me it&#39;s not just skill, but also the tools, the tools, the tools of use. So if if now, students have access to a higher level of skill and tools.

9
00:02:02.460 --&gt; 00:02:12.670
cnabongo: You&#39;d better up up your challenge, which means that if I use, if this simple question now and change that question the entire. It was very advanced level.

10
00:02:13.050 --&gt; 00:02:19.889
cnabongo: But but I need, I need to know what I&#39;m doing as a lecturer. What kind of knowledge.

11
00:02:20.190 --&gt; 00:02:46.350
Abimereki Muzaale: what kind of information am I testing, for example, and that maybe where I used to test only one or 2 elements variables, I can put even up to 10 to variables, knowing very well that the students great point. So the what tools is actually the next thing from after. Look at this image. Someone who is in flow here

12
00:02:46.910 --&gt; 00:02:53.939
Abimereki Muzaale: is moving at the appropriate space that that skill level is matching that challenge level over time.

13
00:02:54.150 --&gt; 00:02:55.360
cnabongo: Yeah.

14
00:02:55.650 --&gt; 00:02:59.199
Abimereki Muzaale: the person who is in the Red Zone needs tools.

15
00:03:00.000 --&gt; 00:03:20.949
Abimereki Muzaale: The person in the green zone you&#39;re not challenging there. So the problem is, yeah. So so the question of people being confused. Well.

16
00:03:21.230 --&gt; 00:03:34.640
Abimereki Muzaale: that content that students needed to know in education is gone. We they do not need to know these things anymore. The challenges should be directed elsewhere.

17
00:03:34.750 --&gt; 00:03:37.230
Abimereki Muzaale: Because if you&#39;re asking, students write an essay.

18
00:03:37.360 --&gt; 00:03:51.630
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, no, yeah, I have chat. Gp, I can write. I can ask for ideas. I&#39;m like this is the topic I&#39;ve been given this, but I come up with and keep editing and say, Oh, okay, now let&#39;s add this, let&#39;s add this, let&#39;s add this so

19
00:03:51.700 --&gt; 00:04:01.080
Abimereki Muzaale: that should not be the ultimate challenge the question is, how can you teach students to use this tool called chat Gp.

20
00:04:01.230 --&gt; 00:04:06.819
Abimereki Muzaale: that is the only question I have for my students in, because I started teaching in April.

21
00:04:06.890 --&gt; 00:04:14.330
Abimereki Muzaale: Enable from day one as like use chargeappity, just copy and paste whatever you&#39;re working on instructivity and ask

22
00:04:14.440 --&gt; 00:04:17.889
Abimereki Muzaale: for some pointers. That&#39;s what I told him.

23
00:04:17.959 --&gt; 00:04:23.039
Abimereki Muzaale: I have nothing negative to say about Gbt, but it&#39;s not the solution.

24
00:04:23.420 --&gt; 00:04:34.400
Abimereki Muzaale: It is just an assistant, I it, which is very important for people.

25
00:04:34.400 --&gt; 00:05:01.870
cnabongo: And you increase the level of complexity.

26
00:05:02.160 --&gt; 00:05:11.349
cnabongo: To actually, really get students to think at another level productive, because, as you say now, people are much more productive with this.

27
00:05:11.510 --&gt; 00:05:25.540
cnabongo: but which is not based on, they are not based on their innate capabilities. So now, how do you? So I think I think it&#39;s a lot of issues should embrace Chat Gp.

28
00:05:25.680 --&gt; 00:05:31.480
cnabongo: And I can tell you. Let me tell you. Let me tell you, Kadi, the issue is

29
00:05:31.540 --&gt; 00:05:59.890
cnabongo: in African universities. People have not even used Powerpoint. People have not even use our psychology teacher from because psychology was across all all subjects and profession. I don&#39;t know whether it taught you at all.

30
00:05:59.890 --&gt; 00:06:13.099
cnabongo: someone else. Yeah, because that those guys were going across all the. But this guys he was reading like 3D. Is not.

31
00:06:13.600 --&gt; 00:06:17.550
cnabongo: and he was reading them for students to write them.

32
00:06:17.560 --&gt; 00:06:46.730
Abimereki Muzaale: so this is a so we&#39;re going to live frog. The way we did with telephones. We did not have land lines. Yeah. People in the village went straight to cell phones. The same thing is going to happen here, I mean, I in my vision would be what I&#39;m sharing with you now that is. Imagine me coming to teach my class tomorrow morning. Yeah.

33
00:06:47.030 --&gt; 00:06:52.020
Abimereki Muzaale: instead of coming. When I came to Johns Hopkins 2,007, 2,006

34
00:06:52.040 --&gt; 00:07:02.710
Abimereki Muzaale: same press. We&#39;re not working class. There&#39;ll be an assist system. They&#39;re handing us. Pdf, not Pdfs printed notes. That is impressive. Then, yeah.

35
00:07:03.000 --&gt; 00:07:09.320
cnabongo: Because you have the teacher&#39;s notes, and you could add additional notes as a teacher goes through the class.

36
00:07:09.390 --&gt; 00:07:13.260
Abimereki Muzaale: But now I&#39;m look, I&#39;m like, Oh, my goodness! That is so old school.

37
00:07:13.300 --&gt; 00:07:24.670
Abimereki Muzaale: Now I all I need to give my students is the URL. I have my notes. Yeah, and I give them something. Oh, this is Microsoft. I give them something like

38
00:07:24.760 --&gt; 00:07:27.329
Abimereki Muzaale: like like this. Yeah.

39
00:07:27.560 --&gt; 00:07:32.110
Abimereki Muzaale: oh, whatever it is. Yeah. I give them that thing as a URL,

40
00:07:32.350 --&gt; 00:07:38.730
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. And then if they use mail phones and then tablets

41
00:07:38.780 --&gt; 00:07:43.449
Abimereki Muzaale: that&#39;s good. They can make additional notes on their on their tablets if they want.

42
00:07:43.580 --&gt; 00:07:55.760
Abimereki Muzaale: but but that&#39;s so that that would people be able to leap frog and not ever use Powerpoint and all those things. So that&#39;s my vision. Yeah, for me, II can assure you I love Powerpoint. I love what

43
00:07:55.840 --&gt; 00:08:20.480
Abimereki Muzaale: I left those things. I have moved on. You know I&#39;m dragging in anyone. No, I was no, no, no, this is just me. III happened to have been doing a Phd and a data science class when so I had all the tools at the public time. So just Hopkins, I still having meetings discussing what to do with AI.

44
00:08:20.980 --&gt; 00:08:39.149
Abimereki Muzaale: How how we they still have those discussions for me. I just blazed through because it caught me in as a student and a professor at the same time. You know that, you know, you know, that now gets me to the point of even yeah, like, like sharing like your approach to lecturing. Because, you know.

45
00:08:39.549 --&gt; 00:08:49.150
cnabongo: when lecturers would come and talk about this theory or this conceptual framework. And and you know. Then they tell you, you go and read this book.

46
00:08:49.870 --&gt; 00:08:58.550
cnabongo: Yeah, you know, in order to help you with understanding what you&#39;ve just the content or the concept and theory that you just discussed.

47
00:08:58.650 --&gt; 00:09:03.059
cnabongo: So you say, Okay. when we come back, please go read these books.

48
00:09:03.350 --&gt; 00:09:25.879
cnabongo: and and then we&#39;ll discuss how far you&#39;ve gone in terms of your understanding. That&#39;s a good example of a typical. So now I can imagine this changes totally. So, my students, this is what my students had to deal with. I they have this content all town. And so if there&#39;s a chapter we&#39;re dealing with, say here

49
00:09:26.080 --&gt; 00:09:34.430
Abimereki Muzaale: and say, if there&#39;s some reading, something I want them to read. I&#39;ll make it a link. I&#39;m trying to see if I have any link. something they can click on for further reading.

50
00:09:34.710 --&gt; 00:09:58.850
cnabongo: or even but but but but but you don&#39;t even need I mean, if you say further reading, I mean Chat Gpu will read for them, so they will just go to chat. Gpus, bring all the reading for them already. So so you have. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say. You have to be a little bit more advanced.

51
00:09:58.890 --&gt; 00:10:16.329
cnabongo: You know what you request to the students, because for them to go and read, they want because they can to read for them, you get my point and actually synthesitize it from them as well. So that so how do you? That&#39;s the challenge. Even now I&#39;m saying you have to

52
00:10:16.360 --&gt; 00:10:17.580
cnabongo: the challenge.

53
00:10:17.730 --&gt; 00:10:27.900
Abimereki Muzaale: So that&#39;s my question to something else. So I I&#39;ll tell you that my from a philosophical perspective, that time is called epistemology. How do you get to know

54
00:10:28.180 --&gt; 00:10:31.489
Abimereki Muzaale: rather than having the knowledge itself?

55
00:10:31.610 --&gt; 00:10:35.680
cnabongo: So yeah, we&#39;re just in the process of getting to know.

56
00:10:35.700 --&gt; 00:10:44.700
Abimereki Muzaale: And so that&#39;s how people should be told, how do you get to use Chat Gp, because before chat, Gp, the number one thing was called Google.

57
00:10:44.960 --&gt; 00:10:47.910
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, how do you use Google?

58
00:10:48.110 --&gt; 00:10:59.509
Abimereki Muzaale: That would. Well, that was a previous question. So the difference in charge every time Google is that Google, you ask me type something, and it gives you it might write a results. Then a specific for what you&#39;ve asked

59
00:10:59.800 --&gt; 00:11:14.010
Abimereki Muzaale: is you&#39;d like dealing with the summary of the smartest person on the planet with all knowledge of all human beings sitting next to you. So he&#39;s giving you exact content precisely for you, con that

60
00:11:14.070 --&gt; 00:11:26.979
Abimereki Muzaale: takes you to another level beyond Google. So the question is, how do I assess where the students have the skills to use the tool called AI

61
00:11:27.750 --&gt; 00:11:30.390
Abimereki Muzaale: Sha Jifi being just one example of AI,

62
00:11:31.060 --&gt; 00:11:37.499
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, because there&#39;s another in my background. Le, listen, hey, siri, what&#39;s the weather like today?

63
00:11:38.330 --&gt; 00:11:45.659
Abimereki Muzaale: Looks like it will be cloudy today. Daytime temperatures will hover around 93 degrees with overnight flows around 69.

64
00:11:46.140 --&gt; 00:11:55.109
Abimereki Muzaale: Hey, Sue, do you recommend that I wear a sweater? Should I take an umbrella boots? What kind of shoes today. Given that info.

65
00:11:56.200 --&gt; 00:12:02.739
Abimereki Muzaale: it&#39;s currently cloudy and 79 degrees. Today&#39;s high will be 93, and the low will be 69 degrees.

66
00:12:03.450 --&gt; 00:12:06.290
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, hey, siri! Should I take an umbrella?

67
00:12:06.870 --&gt; 00:12:07.840
cnabongo: It&#39;s it

68
00:12:07.980 --&gt; 00:12:12.619
Abimereki Muzaale: great! I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s raining right now. So that is AI.

69
00:12:13.080 --&gt; 00:12:19.039
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So that different kinds of AI. The question is, how

70
00:12:19.520 --&gt; 00:12:25.139
Abimereki Muzaale: how can the students be assessed on that ability

71
00:12:25.600 --&gt; 00:12:34.079
Abimereki Muzaale: to utilize these tools? That&#39;s the question, not on their knowledge, because the traditional system has been trying to assess what&#39;s inside here?

72
00:12:34.460 --&gt; 00:12:35.340
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah.

73
00:12:35.600 --&gt; 00:12:53.789
Abimereki Muzaale: we have. So now we can free mine from piling things into that which some people already like. No, no, no, let&#39;s not assess the content of this person&#39;s head. Let&#39;s assess this person&#39;s ability to use tools, because that&#39;s a that&#39;s transferable.

74
00:12:54.510 --&gt; 00:13:04.860
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, that&#39;s a transfer but tool. And and so if you say let&#39;s say, go to charge Gp and say, Chair, Jupiter.

75
00:13:05.740 --&gt; 00:13:08.599
Abimereki Muzaale: can. We are

76
00:13:08.760 --&gt; 00:13:11.249
Abimereki Muzaale: in a conundrum here

77
00:13:13.280 --&gt; 00:13:16.720
Abimereki Muzaale: trying to design your curriculum

78
00:13:19.260 --&gt; 00:13:20.140
Abimereki Muzaale: for

79
00:13:21.260 --&gt; 00:13:29.809
Abimereki Muzaale: 12 to 15 year olds. No, let&#39;s go younger. So 6, 8 to 10 year olds.

80
00:13:31.670 --&gt; 00:13:33.010
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. Olds

81
00:13:33.560 --&gt; 00:13:35.449
Abimereki Muzaale: in light of

82
00:13:35.900 --&gt; 00:13:38.970
Abimereki Muzaale: AI and Chad. Gb, T.

83
00:13:40.790 --&gt; 00:13:43.079
Abimereki Muzaale: So I&#39;ll charge Gp.

84
00:13:43.720 --&gt; 00:13:51.830
Abimereki Muzaale: so we&#39;re really wish to assess the ability to utilize

85
00:13:53.650 --&gt; 00:13:56.780
Abimereki Muzaale: utilize tools like AI.

86
00:13:57.080 --&gt; 00:13:58.220
Abimereki Muzaale: So

87
00:13:58.380 --&gt; 00:14:04.450
Abimereki Muzaale: problems rather than assessing ability

88
00:14:04.670 --&gt; 00:14:09.570
Abimereki Muzaale: to memorize tusks and solutions.

89
00:14:10.820 --&gt; 00:14:12.030
Abimereki Muzaale: We expect

90
00:14:13.760 --&gt; 00:14:15.340
Abimereki Muzaale: expect

91
00:14:16.520 --&gt; 00:14:17.720
Abimereki Muzaale: the

92
00:14:18.280 --&gt; 00:14:23.530
Abimereki Muzaale: use of AI to be the transferable skill.

93
00:14:25.450 --&gt; 00:14:29.120
Abimereki Muzaale: So help us give an outline.

94
00:14:29.370 --&gt; 00:14:31.490
Abimereki Muzaale: What a curriculum

95
00:14:32.990 --&gt; 00:14:38.100
Abimereki Muzaale: would look like in this day and edge.

96
00:14:39.440 --&gt; 00:14:40.750
Abimereki Muzaale: Let&#39;s see.

97
00:14:41.260 --&gt; 00:14:51.049
Abimereki Muzaale: it&#39;s a very broad question. So you you can ask so many question. A huge, the more precise your question is the better value you get.

98
00:14:51.330 --&gt; 00:14:57.680
Abimereki Muzaale: If you give you a vague, you may not get what&#39;s helpful, so I try to bring in details here.

99
00:14:58.080 --&gt; 00:15:04.390
Abimereki Muzaale: Ii? Oh, I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going to go. Great to go thinking

100
00:15:04.840 --&gt; 00:15:07.289
cnabongo: problem solving. This is life skills.

101
00:15:11.770 --&gt; 00:15:14.820
cnabongo: this programming concepts. Wow!

102
00:15:16.070 --&gt; 00:15:17.590
cnabongo: My God!

103
00:15:18.880 --&gt; 00:15:27.069
Abimereki Muzaale: Given the progress. Huh? Oh, oh, is it? Why is it saying in 4 to 6 weeks? Where does this weeks represent?

104
00:15:28.970 --&gt; 00:15:39.099
cnabongo: Maybe the time for learning the outcomes learning outcomes. I don&#39;t think I got my the edge correct. This sounds a little beyond the edge.

105
00:15:39.170 --&gt; 00:16:03.819
Abimereki Muzaale: Let&#39;s say what it should, I suggested. Students could begin here. And I like that.

106
00:16:03.830 --&gt; 00:16:11.499
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, I mean, that&#39;s the tool. Let&#39;s that&#39;s the tool duration. I think I think it&#39;s a duration.

107
00:16:11.820 --&gt; 00:16:14.700
cnabongo: Yeah, yeah. Well, that section that section.

108
00:16:14.900 --&gt; 00:16:19.590
cnabongo: So they they already. Because if you want them to the the

109
00:16:19.700 --&gt; 00:16:29.880
cnabongo: the skill is there, but the skill to actually even identify the right tools and application. But then those tools as well as the technology need to be understood.

110
00:16:30.050 --&gt; 00:16:30.980
Haven&#39;t.

111
00:16:31.120 --&gt; 00:16:45.669
cnabongo: Because part number 2 problem solving is now you&#39;re getting the skills and which is beyond just memorizing this problem. Critical thinking, this life skills. As I said, thinking logical thinking.

112
00:16:45.840 --&gt; 00:16:53.610
Abimereki Muzaale:  So it makes for me from an education point of view, this, what we do, it comes or it&#39;s automatic. It&#39;s automatic.

113
00:16:53.660 --&gt; 00:16:59.930
cnabongo: Yeah, yeah, like, project based, learning is more the practical practical work.

114
00:17:00.100 --&gt; 00:17:13.760
Abimereki Muzaale: So so so from the perspective of you, from your perspective. Even if the teachers do not have a familiarity with AI, you could do this with AI, actually, what I&#39;m learning now

115
00:17:13.819 --&gt; 00:17:22.750
Abimereki Muzaale: is what we did talking all along. Because, we have been the more content based learning the normal academic work.

116
00:17:22.770 --&gt; 00:17:35.330
cnabongo: This life skills has always been in the background, and people even determine. People determine what are the learning outcomes like? What are you really testing here

117
00:17:35.540 --&gt; 00:17:37.150
cnabongo: rather than the knowledge

118
00:17:37.170 --&gt; 00:17:38.280
cnabongo: itself.

119
00:17:38.330 --&gt; 00:17:47.829
cnabongo: You are testing certain skills here, competencies for actually understanding, collecting knowledge and utilizing, applying knowledge

120
00:17:48.200 --&gt; 00:17:50.690
cnabongo: being, yeah, the right set of minds

121
00:17:50.970 --&gt; 00:18:04.549
cnabongo: staying calm, even as you answer, do you think so? This is this has always been. Other people don&#39;t test this, and their education is find problems, even determining learning outcomes out of this one.

122
00:18:04.940 --&gt; 00:18:19.110
cnabongo: Yeah, so quite often, even, they are challenged without teach it, they think, is this actually taught? Or it is developed because you can put this into another theoretical learning, and people ask again.

123
00:18:19.250 --&gt; 00:18:34.559
Abimereki Muzaale: but it should be developed as I mean, it&#39;s queue under that, or is the challenge? So that that&#39;s a challenge. And and one thing that I&#39;m learning from this psychologist here is that you have to assist progress frequently.

124
00:18:34.670 --&gt; 00:18:39.050
Abimereki Muzaale: Now, you&#39;d be like frequently miss more for the teachers, more hallmarks. But that should not be a problem.

125
00:18:39.060 --&gt; 00:18:43.090
Abimereki Muzaale: Because they&#39;re ways where people can assist themselves.

126
00:18:43.190 --&gt; 00:18:53.849
Abimereki Muzaale: You can, you can say the teacher has limited time, but we need assessment every week. And you can you design itself? Can you incorporate self assessment? Yeah.

127
00:18:55.370 --&gt; 00:18:59.520
Abimereki Muzaale: let&#39;s tailor this to 8 year olds.

128
00:19:00.180 --&gt; 00:19:03.800
Abimereki Muzaale: and incorporate very frequent

129
00:19:04.040 --&gt; 00:19:07.480
Abimereki Muzaale: assessments and feedback

130
00:19:07.790 --&gt; 00:19:09.330
for progress.

131
00:19:10.010 --&gt; 00:19:19.150
Abimereki Muzaale: Keep in mind that the teacher has the teacher, student. Ratio is

132
00:19:19.920 --&gt; 00:19:22.930
Abimereki Muzaale: one to 150,

133
00:19:23.180 --&gt; 00:19:31.330
Abimereki Muzaale: and has limited time so open to ideas like self-assessment

134
00:19:32.430 --&gt; 00:19:33.870
Abimereki Muzaale: and Pierre.

135
00:19:34.450 --&gt; 00:19:48.769
Abimereki Muzaale: assessment this opening up ideas. Let&#39;s see, what should you have to say? So. One thing sure, my, all my students said, we need more frequent assessments, because I was only assessing 3 times in the town.

136
00:19:48.910 --&gt; 00:19:52.439
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. And they felt it was unfair, and it was overwhelming.

137
00:19:52.670 --&gt; 00:19:54.790
Abimereki Muzaale: But if you broke down

138
00:19:54.800 --&gt; 00:20:05.149
Abimereki Muzaale: the tasks into smaller tasks, and therefore more frequent assessments that oh, very many students said that. And in in learning Psychology Fund, that that&#39;s also us recommended

139
00:20:05.370 --&gt; 00:20:26.399
Abimereki Muzaale: frequent assessments. Now, the next problem would be like, who do you have the resources to assess. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve incorporated here the issue of one. The student teacher issues teacher, student ratios, one to 150. Yes, of the situation, and and so

140
00:20:26.710 --&gt; 00:20:29.550
Abimereki Muzaale: they&#39;ll be yeah, not their recommendations.

141
00:20:29.600 --&gt; 00:20:32.750
cnabongo: You can see, doesn&#39;t want to.

142
00:20:33.000 --&gt; 00:20:36.679
Abimereki Muzaale: It&#39;s not I&#39;ve told you that it&#39;s it is an 8 year old.

143
00:20:36.690 --&gt; 00:20:53.450
Abimereki Muzaale: because, you know, the kids, the kids these days are learning at a higher level than we did. You know what we used to do. Primary 7 it&#39;s being done at NASA right now.

144
00:20:53.520 --&gt; 00:21:13.550
cnabongo: yes, totally. And as you&#39;re seeing with different tools now, the kids you&#39;re talking about are using computers. Now, look, II look here, interactive games, quick quizzes or interactive games, things you would have never dreamed of in our primary. No, I know, I know.

145
00:21:13.660 --&gt; 00:21:28.520
cnabongo: and it also depends on the level, because you can have all these things. You look there. They they are complicated, but it&#39;s just deliver at which you are looking. In nursery there can be assessments which you&#39;re

146
00:21:28.570 --&gt; 00:21:31.510
cnabongo: we are looking at the outcomes.

147
00:21:31.720 --&gt; 00:21:47.549
Abimereki Muzaale: Now, now look at this building. Now, this is where AI comes in creating with technology, you&#39;ll be like, you don&#39;t have the skills for this world. But you have charge. You could be like, okay, I have 8 year olds. And I&#39;m at this stage teaching them this how to build some simple animation that stories.

148
00:21:47.630 --&gt; 00:21:53.829
cnabongo: Yeah, yeah, this. This is normal. Now, if you look at the I was just looking at actually an ipad for

149
00:21:54.140 --&gt; 00:22:11.390
cnabongo: for children at the before they even go to standard one. This stuff that they are using. And this is what we are talking about here. This is it. And if you see a one year or 2 year old.

150
00:22:11.920 --&gt; 00:22:26.160
Abimereki Muzaale: absolutely absorbed, on which they cannot, which they cannot when they get human being in the so so the time use that&#39;s called flow.

151
00:22:26.250 --&gt; 00:22:45.639
Abimereki Muzaale: The other time is called engagement. So keeping students here for me, I&#39;ve never had this concept when this concept arrived from negative feedback from students. And II did my research. I was like, Oh, my goodness, I need to keep people engage. So my class is 150.

152
00:22:45.780 --&gt; 00:22:51.139
Abimereki Muzaale: I&#39;ve decided for next year. I&#39;m I&#39;m going to offer 3 different classes

153
00:22:51.160 --&gt; 00:23:08.820
Abimereki Muzaale: because these people cannot be in the same class. The the skill levels are so different. There&#39;s no way I can engage these people at the same way. So I&#39;m going up 3 different classes and said at any time, I don&#39;t engage someone, and then they&#39;re done just another, you know.

154
00:23:08.820 --&gt; 00:23:35.539
Abimereki Muzaale: So so you have. You have to tailor Taylor. So maybe a basic class for people who would have been here, and an intermediate class and advanced class for the most part. What the issue for me is that they&#39;re all in the same class. Oh, that that&#39;s fine, that that can be also that can also be. If if split, having different classes, not something you can afford.

155
00:23:35.540 --&gt; 00:23:41.990
Abimereki Muzaale: Then you can. You can. You can ask. Try Gpg to guide you with content.

156
00:23:42.110 --&gt; 00:24:09.520
Abimereki Muzaale: You can give outlines and say, I have this number of students who have very different skill levels. I want to be able to keep those who are way advanced engaged, and those who are the least advanced not anxious while engaging the average, who are maybe at the majority. And that&#39;s a real challenge scheduled. And you find very nice solutions. But before we finish here, cause this is recording, I would just wanted to demonstrate one thing. This

157
00:24:09.560 --&gt; 00:24:14.439
Abimereki Muzaale: I saw a graph like this, and II described to charge Gp.

158
00:24:14.450 --&gt; 00:24:21.580
Abimereki Muzaale: How to what? What language can give you a figure? It can&#39;t give you this.

159
00:24:21.950 --&gt; 00:24:30.119
Abimereki Muzaale: so I know it only does language. So I was like, give me python code to produce a graph that has challenge level on the Y axis.

160
00:24:30.170 --&gt; 00:24:34.930
Abimereki Muzaale: scale them on the x-axis. And I said, the diagonal, Yeah.

161
00:24:35.300 --&gt; 00:24:38.490
Abimereki Muzaale: has a.

162
00:24:38.630 --&gt; 00:24:44.830
Abimereki Muzaale: The dagger is accessible. I call this assign web. And then I describe this thing. Then you give me this code.

163
00:24:44.840 --&gt; 00:24:54.910
Abimereki Muzaale: Give me this call. I did so. This is stuff you copy and paste for this purpose is you fucked? Let me just use the last demonstration.

164
00:24:54.990 --&gt; 00:25:07.770
Abimereki Muzaale: Chad, gp, T.  this. please give me python cord to produce a graph

165
00:25:07.990 --&gt; 00:25:12.020
Abimereki Muzaale: with Y-axis challenge level

166
00:25:13.910 --&gt; 00:25:18.290
Abimereki Muzaale: X. The more precise the request, the better the results.

167
00:25:18.320 --&gt; 00:25:21.720
Abimereki Muzaale: X-axis Q level.

168
00:25:24.240 --&gt; 00:25:28.890
Abimereki Muzaale: then it diagonal line. Diagonal line

169
00:25:30.060 --&gt; 00:25:31.520
Abimereki Muzaale: of white

170
00:25:31.530 --&gt; 00:25:33.089
Abimereki Muzaale: is equal to X

171
00:25:35.150 --&gt; 00:25:44.120
Abimereki Muzaale: and and the same function. This. And II use my my mathematics understanding function with

172
00:25:44.270 --&gt; 00:25:48.669
Abimereki Muzaale: that. They&#39;re gonna align as its axis

173
00:25:50.160 --&gt; 00:26:01.319
Abimereki Muzaale: lit the area above the diagonal gonna align be colored red. the area

174
00:26:01.450 --&gt; 00:26:06.380
Abimereki Muzaale: below color green and the

175
00:26:06.570 --&gt; 00:26:09.480
Abimereki Muzaale: x is bigger. Y zone.

176
00:26:10.190 --&gt; 00:26:16.370
Abimereki Muzaale: Yo. let&#39;s label red. Anxious.

177
00:26:17.000 --&gt; 00:26:19.730
Abimereki Muzaale:  I just

178
00:26:20.770 --&gt; 00:26:23.410
Abimereki Muzaale: agreement board

179
00:26:25.180 --&gt; 00:26:27.730
Abimereki Muzaale: yellow. Well.

180
00:26:32.180 --&gt; 00:26:52.070
Abimereki Muzaale: sure you can create a graph. Those characteristics. And again, don&#39;t be II told myself. Please don&#39;t be intimidated by the quote I&#39;m giving you. But they got intimidated. I&#39;m like, no, no, no, children, I&#39;m not intimidated by things we don&#39;t understand. Just copy and paste that you&#39;ll be fine.

181
00:26:52.540 --&gt; 00:26:54.400
Abimereki Muzaale: so let&#39;s see.

182
00:26:54.740 --&gt; 00:27:24.239
Abimereki Muzaale: So for me, I&#39;m so comfortable not understanding anything here, but later you&#39;re like, Oh, I can edit this. I can edit some. Somebody is doing the background work for you. I work. I mean, that&#39;s the whole idea. Right? Yeah. Yeah. But you don&#39;t need to spend the 2 weeks straight. Exactly. So now we have caught for you. So that&#39;s part of the skill I noticed. Huh? So now that&#39;s I. Now, I&#39;m gonna use this in Google&#39;s python environment. So I&#39;m going to go to Google.

183
00:27:24.810 --&gt; 00:27:43.930
cnabongo: I thought, it&#39;s going to generate that. No python, it gives you language. So it&#39;s given me. Python. Provide the graph. No, it&#39;s a language. So language call a large language model. It doesn&#39;t do graphs, figures and features. Okay, so what happens now, after you&#39;ve asked to that. So I&#39;m going to get that code.

184
00:27:44.120 --&gt; 00:27:48.920
Abimereki Muzaale: I got you leaked the code. Yeah, I&#39;m going to get the code. So for now. Oh, I forgot to copy.

185
00:27:48.940 --&gt; 00:27:55.109
cnabongo: Let me copy. Oh, so you have nowhere to, you see. Click here, copy. Okay.

186
00:27:55.140 --&gt; 00:28:04.259
Abimereki Muzaale: then, I&#39;m not going to go to Google. It&#39;s something called co-lab. I&#39;m doing this for the recording purposes that can see this top result. Welcome to co-lab.

187
00:28:05.210 --&gt; 00:28:07.030
Abimereki Muzaale: And I&#39;m going to go to file

188
00:28:07.390 --&gt; 00:28:19.260
Abimereki Muzaale: file new book. You can save books here and and all that. But I&#39;m just gonna copy right now. I&#39;m just copying this. I&#39;m going to run without understanding a thing.

189
00:28:20.130 --&gt; 00:28:37.109
Abimereki Muzaale: Let&#39;s see, I don&#39;t know how faithful is very important. Okay, it does not produce what I wanted. But that&#39;s for steps. Yeah, we we can. Yeah, it has done a general picture. Yeah, general idea that the middle is

190
00:28:37.270 --&gt; 00:28:56.229
Abimereki Muzaale: candidates candidates

191
00:28:56.530 --&gt; 00:29:07.309
cnabongo: so that they are to see their capability to read certain graphs. And this was a scattagram, actually, which shows which shows a bit of

192
00:29:07.650 --&gt; 00:29:15.330
cnabongo: I think the the deployment of students are Banuru and the rest of it

193
00:29:15.620 --&gt; 00:29:24.750
cnabongo: rather teachers, the distribution of teachers. according to the to the to the rural and urban

194
00:29:25.340 --&gt; 00:29:29.209
cnabongo: kind of situation. So you can see, you know.

195
00:29:29.370 --&gt; 00:29:35.629
cnabongo: based on the

196
00:29:35.680 --&gt; 00:29:59.970
cnabongo: kind of communities. And I ended up doing it manually, because, you know, I tried to be smart and realize that. So I decided to do actually do this graph physically, I do sounded very funny to people who are really, ICT proficient.

197
00:30:00.410 --&gt; 00:30:03.579
Abimereki Muzaale: What&#39;s the way access on your graph and receive as a

198
00:30:04.170 --&gt; 00:30:11.200
cnabongo: I think it&#39;s the number of teachers, and it&#39;s on one side is the number of teachers.

199
00:30:11.400 --&gt; 00:30:17.149
cnabongo: then on the other. On the I think that&#39;s on the Y-axis, on the X-axis. You have the

200
00:30:17.210 --&gt; 00:30:18.979
cnabongo: the distance from

201
00:30:19.320 --&gt; 00:30:24.410
cnabongo: from urban areas, you know. So the distance the further away

202
00:30:25.200 --&gt; 00:30:35.700
cnabongo: the schools are from from you know from the urban centers. So you have the number of teachers. one site

203
00:30:36.160 --&gt; 00:30:39.889
cnabongo: looking at the distance from the urban.

204
00:30:39.940 --&gt; 00:30:43.410
cnabongo: Yeah. In other words, when you are looking at deployment of teachers.

205
00:30:43.700 --&gt; 00:30:51.340
cnabongo: It changes with the distance from urban centers. You get it,

206
00:30:52.670 --&gt; 00:31:05.989
cnabongo: So that&#39;s catagram, and it can be different for different places. If you have a community like maybe Uganda, where there is better deployment, equitable deployment of teachers.

207
00:31:06.070 --&gt; 00:31:17.449
cnabongo: You see, the scattergram changes different when you&#39;re in a certain communities where the there is inequitable distribution of teachers due to factors, and everybody is concentrated in urban areas.

208
00:31:17.750 --&gt; 00:31:27.410
cnabongo: Then you see, this catagram changes from community to community. So Uganda would be different from Liberia, from Syria, and depending on the level of development and equity.

209
00:31:27.440 --&gt; 00:31:31.890
cnabongo: Because, you know, when when teachers are deployed sometimes.

210
00:31:32.310 --&gt; 00:31:48.069
cnabongo: and you find that you stay in urban areas because everything is there. But if you make sure that you&#39;ve resourced properly rural areas and have dealt out. We said there incentivization. You know, it&#39;s much more equitable. So when you look at that scattergram

211
00:31:48.300 --&gt; 00:32:00.930
cnabongo: in general

212
00:32:00.980 --&gt; 00:32:09.299
cnabongo: in the places where equity it&#39;s not equitable, where equity is not okay, places where

213
00:32:09.640 --&gt; 00:32:15.249
cnabongo: where the there is inequitable teacher allocation and deployment distribution.

214
00:32:15.960 --&gt; 00:32:22.179
cnabongo: Then you&#39;ll find that teachers in in those places. There&#39;s a higher teacher, pupil ratio.

215
00:32:23.500 --&gt; 00:32:26.509
you know. You have much to like. For example, you&#39;ve mentioned

216
00:32:26.720 --&gt; 00:32:53.780
cnabongo: that at university for you dealing with 150 students. I mean, I&#39;m finding. I thought I thought lecturers would have fewer students. Oh, no, no, universes. A bigger customer, more advanced students. They don&#39;t need the the, the much care like the higher level of education, the the bigger the number of students like the top universities.

217
00:32:54.100 --&gt; 00:33:00.490
cnabongo: so so so that yeah, you you in this question use the word scattagram.

218
00:33:10.020 --&gt; 00:33:16.910
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, yeah, exactly. Let&#39;s see. So the more precise definitely the more

219
00:33:17.210 --&gt; 00:33:18.979
Abimereki Muzaale: useful to be.

220
00:33:19.320 --&gt; 00:33:35.810
Abimereki Muzaale: This is a lot of info. Hopefully it will be useful, let&#39;s see. But I just want to show you that you should never, ever do that?

221
00:33:35.810 --&gt; 00:33:51.180
cnabongo: Yeah, because I tried to do excel. Then I realized that lost all my plot. How I used to develop, excel you should never. II decided to just do manual. I must have looked very funny to to the testing.

222
00:33:51.180 --&gt; 00:34:04.310
Abimereki Muzaale:  again, I&#39;m going to Google, call up

223
00:34:04.810 --&gt; 00:34:07.660
Abimereki Muzaale: file new.

224
00:34:07.950 --&gt; 00:34:12.189
Abimereki Muzaale: I hope this is, a very compelling example.

225
00:34:12.770 --&gt; 00:34:16.500
Abimereki Muzaale: II told it to make up data, made up data.

226
00:34:19.000 --&gt; 00:34:24.989
Abimereki Muzaale: Look at that.

227
00:34:25.070 --&gt; 00:34:28.550
Abimereki Muzaale: Look at that. This is a big thing

228
00:34:28.650 --&gt; 00:34:36.739
cnabongo: fake data absolutely. And by country, yeah. And this is.

229
00:34:36.860 --&gt; 00:34:41.920
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah. Kenya is yellow. No, this is fake. It&#39;s fake. I told you to make up data.

230
00:34:42.489 --&gt; 00:34:53.340
cnabongo: Yeah, yeah.

231
00:34:53.350 --&gt; 00:35:13.649
Abimereki Muzaale: that&#39;s the first thing that comes to your mind fake. Yeah. Because sometimes you want to do effect, you are simply examining. Yeah, candidates ability to interpret the data. So I wanted to do something like this. And then I want them to interpret this data. So so the question, so I&#39;m like, okay.

232
00:35:13.690 --&gt; 00:35:21.779
cnabongo: given that this information, can you tell me? Let me ask Jp to set questions.

233
00:35:21.800 --&gt; 00:35:25.859
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, so who are you targeting administrators or teachers?

234
00:35:25.880 --&gt; 00:35:27.230
Abimereki Muzaale: Administrators.

235
00:35:27.400 --&gt; 00:35:30.980
cnabongo: These? These I&#39;m target jetting managers.

236
00:35:31.020 --&gt; 00:35:44.729
cnabongo: yeah, administrators, policy makers. People are going to be in management position. And I would like them to interpret the data, because then they have to address, they have to mitigate and create solutions to this problem because it&#39;s a problem.

237
00:35:44.880 --&gt; 00:35:58.749
cnabongo: Okay, they have different. They have different situations and scenarios, and they have to provide the to adapt different solutions to different communities. So they have to describe that particular community. What are the problems they see.

238
00:35:59.260 --&gt; 00:36:07.569
cnabongo: and then and then create solutions for the different. So, for example, now, in those, how many questions, how many questions should you ask?

239
00:36:09.040 --&gt; 00:36:11.669
cnabongo: Let me see.

240
00:36:12.920 --&gt; 00:36:17.649
cnabongo: just one question, actually, just one. Just one question, or let&#39;s just say 3.

241
00:36:17.760 --&gt; 00:36:23.049
Abimereki Muzaale: That&#39;s awesome. You can ask 3. We can see they have to describe

242
00:36:23.230 --&gt; 00:36:26.969
cnabongo: the different communities. the different

243
00:36:27.010 --&gt; 00:36:34.219
cnabongo: they have to describe, that scenario for the different communities. So they have to interpret what they see in the graph.

244
00:36:34.580 --&gt; 00:36:42.999
cnabongo: and then they have. The second question would be. what would be the solution to the problem that has been analyzed?

245
00:36:43.500 --&gt; 00:36:50.540
cnabongo: That would be the second question, what would be the solution, including policy, including policy solutions.

246
00:36:51.070 --&gt; 00:37:06.519
cnabongo: So that would be the second question. The first one is that they have to interpret the data. Okay, what is the problem and issue this? So the second question is the solution, the poly, the solutions, including policy solutions.

247
00:37:08.630 --&gt; 00:37:13.240
cnabongo: Anticipated barriers anticipated challenges.

248
00:37:14.560 --&gt; 00:37:17.520
cnabongo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the final one.

249
00:37:18.490 --&gt; 00:37:25.310
cnabongo: No recommendations, maybe. But that is the solutions already. I think that&#39;s the 2 questions. Okay?

250
00:37:25.930 --&gt; 00:37:27.730
Abimereki Muzaale: And then just add challenges

251
00:37:27.790 --&gt; 00:37:28.800
cnabongo: to

252
00:37:28.810 --&gt; 00:37:30.490
Abimereki Muzaale: proposed solutions.

253
00:37:33.730 --&gt; 00:37:40.359
Abimereki Muzaale: Okay, let&#39;s see. And and the nice thing that this is just like a a template for status. And I can allow you to reflect.

254
00:37:40.510 --&gt; 00:37:44.370
Abimereki Muzaale: And say, Oh, we can, we can edit this, this past question.

255
00:37:44.460 --&gt; 00:37:46.050
Abimereki Muzaale: or this and that.

256
00:37:46.810 --&gt; 00:37:49.509
Abimereki Muzaale: And so you can imagine

257
00:37:51.400 --&gt; 00:37:55.200
Abimereki Muzaale: you can move all this content into that website to prepare.

258
00:37:55.660 --&gt; 00:37:56.750
cnabongo: You. Remember?

259
00:37:57.700 --&gt; 00:38:03.049
Abimereki Muzaale: Well, I the graph. In fact, that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do and and give you the URL.

260
00:38:03.300 --&gt; 00:38:20.930
Abimereki Muzaale: But so we had a picture of, okay, maybe not. Today. I think we&#39;re right out of time. But so you have questions. Yeah, question, analyze kind of put representing the number of teachers against distance from urban areas with school. What is the data suggest about the equity?

261
00:38:21.060 --&gt; 00:38:28.679
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. how does this scenario differ from 3 countries? And what&#39;s the implication? Might this have for education, access and quality?

262
00:38:28.830 --&gt; 00:38:30.180
cnabongo: That&#39;s a nice one.

263
00:38:30.350 --&gt; 00:38:52.579
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, exactly. Is this it? You are writing this week?

264
00:38:52.950 --&gt; 00:39:02.879
Abimereki Muzaale: Questions. So that&#39;s the first question very beautifully wide. Yeah.

265
00:39:03.110 --&gt; 00:39:09.759
Abimereki Muzaale: then, based on the insights Glen from the scatterplot. What are the underlying causes of this disparities in teacher distribution

266
00:39:10.010 --&gt; 00:39:27.389
Abimereki Muzaale: proposed solutions, address identify problems. You could specific innovations, programs, partnerships.

267
00:39:27.410 --&gt; 00:39:45.540
Abimereki Muzaale: anticipate reflecting on the proposed solutions what potential challenges of virus might be encountered in the implementation, consider political will infrastructure constraints, contextual elements.

268
00:39:46.050 --&gt; 00:39:46.830
Abimereki Muzaale: Huh?

269
00:39:47.200 --&gt; 00:39:57.109
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So look at this. It&#39;s a practical question that I actually asked, so let&#39;s see. So so you mean, it&#39;s gonna give me the answers now.

270
00:39:57.390 --&gt; 00:40:03.989
cnabongo: No, no, no, these are just questions. To that you are. These are these are questions. Now, if you had to ask those questions

271
00:40:04.200 --&gt; 00:40:09.680
Abimereki Muzaale: based on based on the others, categorize it for users, you want answers.

272
00:40:10.020 --&gt; 00:40:16.630
cnabongo: Yeah, yeah, based on based on that scata gram. You remember the scata gram that you created there

273
00:40:17.000 --&gt; 00:40:21.510
cnabongo: the one that you created this this one?

274
00:40:21.600 --&gt; 00:40:34.910
Abimereki Muzaale: So if you can, if you can say, based on this category? To actually answer those questions, can you produce

275
00:40:35.230 --&gt; 00:40:38.890
Abimereki Muzaale: and and so what&#39;s the term answer key

276
00:40:40.230 --&gt; 00:40:42.480
cnabongo:  thanks

277
00:40:46.110 --&gt; 00:40:48.499
cnabongo: I hope it&#39;s not too complicated for it.

278
00:40:59.840 --&gt; 00:41:02.720
cnabongo: Wow! You look at what you&#39;re saying.

279
00:41:05.120 --&gt; 00:41:06.220
cnabongo: Very good.

280
00:41:07.930 --&gt; 00:41:12.669
Abimereki Muzaale: You got a piece of the most equitable. I deliberately set it up that way. So that&#39;s correct.

281
00:41:13.030 --&gt; 00:41:15.540
Abimereki Muzaale: And it&#39;s just

282
00:41:15.680 --&gt; 00:41:23.050
Abimereki Muzaale: lack of infrastructure. Blah, blah, blah and Uganda. a

283
00:41:23.440 --&gt; 00:41:24.360
cnabongo: well.

284
00:41:24.710 --&gt; 00:41:25.580
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah.

285
00:41:25.800 --&gt; 00:41:35.940
Abimereki Muzaale: yeah, yeah. It sounds.

286
00:41:36.060 --&gt; 00:41:39.760
Abimereki Muzaale: Oh, my God.

287
00:41:41.720 --&gt; 00:41:46.850
Abimereki Muzaale: if this is your passports. Imagine if you improve this over a week. Huh?

288
00:41:46.910 --&gt; 00:41:48.510
cnabongo: I know.

289
00:41:48.700 --&gt; 00:42:00.860
Abimereki Muzaale: Yeah. So so this freezing and look and look, I did even talk about Unicef. Look at where it is. Oh, no, no! I mentioned Unicef, so the more precision you add, the better.

290
00:42:01.640 --&gt; 00:42:08.019
Abimereki Muzaale: That I mentioned Unicef I mentioned West Africa also. So so yeah.

291
00:42:08.070 --&gt; 00:42:15.380
Abimereki Muzaale: so any this is recorded. I&#39;m going to stop by not the recording to be too big for you. But it&#39;s gonna be a URL. So I&#39;m going to share

292
00:42:15.480 --&gt; 00:42:17.990
Abimereki Muzaale: you are the recordings.

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Transitioning from traditional office tools like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel to web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can feel intimidating, especially without any programming knowledge. But fear not! Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to help you make this transition smoothly:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Understand Why</strong>: Clarify the reasons why you want to make this transition. Understanding your goals can make the process more manageable and keep you motivated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learn Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>HTML</strong>: Start by learning the basic structure of HTML, which forms the backbone of web pages. There are plenty of free online resources like Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), W3Schools, and FreeCodeCamp.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CSS</strong>: Next, learn CSS to style the HTML content. Focus on the basics like selecting elements, setting colors, and managing layouts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Finally, explore basic JavaScript to add interactivity to the pages.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Practice Building Simple Web Pages</strong>: Start small. Create a simple web page with text, images, and links. Gradually add styles and interactivity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use a Code Editor</strong>: Tools like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom can be very helpful in writing and organizing your code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider Using a Framework or Template</strong>: If building everything from scratch feels overwhelming, consider using frameworks like Bootstrap or templates that align with your goals. This can simplify the process significantly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explore GitHub Pages (gh-pages)</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Create a GitHub Account</strong>: Sign up on GitHub if you haven’t already.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learn Basic Git Commands</strong>: Familiarize yourself with basic Git commands. You don’t need to become an expert, just understand how to clone, commit, push, and pull.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create a Repository and Enable GitHub Pages</strong>: Follow GitHub’s guide to create a repository and enable GitHub Pages for hosting your site.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Deploy Your Site</strong>: Add your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the GitHub repository, and follow the instructions to deploy your site on GitHub Pages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continue Learning and Experimenting</strong>: Like any skill, practice makes perfect. Continue building, experimenting, and learning from various resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider a Structured Learning Path</strong>: If you find that self-guided learning is a challenge, consider enrolling in an online course or bootcamp that aligns with your goals. Many platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or Codecademy offer beginner-friendly courses on web development.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask for Help When Needed</strong>: Don’t hesitate to seek help from online forums like Stack Overflow or developer communities. Sometimes, a little guidance from others can go a long way.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have Patience</strong>: Remember, this is a new skill, and it might take time to become comfortable. Stay patient and keep learning at your own pace.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, you don’t have to abandon your existing skills in the Office suite. Understanding how to work with documents, presentations, and spreadsheets can complement your newfound web development abilities. Good luck on your journey!</p>
<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>
<p>We demonstrated how to create a simple web page using HTML.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>We created a GitHub account, then a repository within the account called “Demo”, and created a file called index.html and added the following code and committed the changes:</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Hello, World!
</pre></div>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>We then enabled GitHub Pages for the repository by going to Settings &gt; Pages and selecting the main branch as the source.</p></li>
<li><p>We then visited the URL provided by GitHub Pages to <a class="reference external" href="https://muzaale.github.io/demo/">view</a> the web page.</p></li>
<li><p>We later copied and pasted the following code from ChatGPT to the index.html file and committed the changes:</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight-html notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>My First Web Page<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Hello, World!<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>This is a paragraph.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>CSS</strong></p>
<p>At this point, we had a simple and dull web page with some text. After adding additional text with the help of ChatGPT (Declaring this an autobiography with suggested Table of Contents by ChatGPT), we then added some CSS code from ChatGPT to style the page. It made the white page glossy, background sky blue, and added some padding to the text.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript</strong>*</p>
<p>Finally, we added some JavaScript code from ChatGPT to add an image to the <a class="reference external" href="https://muzaale.github.io/demo2/">page</a>. Javascript should be able to do more, e.g. adding interactivity to the webpage. For instance, it can make the text change color when the mouse hovers over it. Or it can also make the page display a different image when a button is clicked. We’ll explore these features in future sessions.</p>

  <summary>3. ChatGPT</summary>
<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong></p>
<p>ChatGPT is a tool that uses the GPT-3 language model to generate text based on a prompt (I actually used the latest GPT-4 language model; I pay $20/month for this service). It can be used to generate text for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Writing</strong>: You can use ChatGPT to generate text for a variety of purposes, including writing articles, stories, and poems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Programming</strong>: You can use ChatGPT to generate code for a variety of purposes, including writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Design</strong>: You can use ChatGPT to generate designs for a variety of purposes, including logos, websites, and posters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Music</strong>: You can use ChatGPT to generate music for a variety of purposes, including songs, soundtracks, and jingles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Art</strong>: You can use ChatGPT to generate art for a variety of purposes, including paintings, drawings, and sculptures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Games</strong>: You can use ChatGPT to generate games for a variety of purposes, including board games, card games, and video games. This can be leveraged to create games with educational and engaging content for students.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recipes</strong>: You can use ChatGPT to generate recipes for a variety of purposes, including cooking, baking, and brewing. etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Use ChatGPT</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Go to <a class="reference external" href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the “Sign Up” button and create an account.</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to chat as you would with a human being. You can ask questions, make requests, or provide instructions. You can also use the “Examples” button to see how others have used ChatGPT.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ChatGPT Examples</strong></p>
<p>Write an article on any topic and ask ChatGPT to generate a summary or edit the article. Repeat this process iteratively until you are satisfied with the results.</p>
<p>Or ask ChatGPT to give you .HTML, .CSS, .JavaScript code or even Python code that helps with specific tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Scattergram</strong></p>
<p>Request: simulate data as follows y-axis number of teachers, x-axis the distance from urban areas that the school is. produce a scatter-gram for schools from (Uganda - red, Botswana - blue, Kenya - yellow). in general the further the school is from the urban areas, the fewer the teachers (in inequitable area). lets say Uganda is the most equitable, Kenya the least (student-teacher ratio as)</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Certainly! We can simulate data according to the description and create a scatter plot to visualize it. Here’s a code snippet that should help:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>see below
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this code, we’ve created data that generally follows the pattern that the further a school is from urban areas, the fewer the teachers. The slopes of the relationships differ between countries, reflecting the levels of equity described, with Uganda having the most equitable distribution and Kenya the least. The scatter plot is colored accordingly, with red for Uganda, blue for Botswana, and yellow for Kenya.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Google Colab</strong></p>
<p>Google Colab is a free cloud service that provides access to a GPU and TPU. It can be used for various purposes, including machine learning, data analysis, and education. It can also be used to run Python code and Jupyter notebooks.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Go to <a class="reference external" href="https://colab.research.google.com">Google Colab</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the “Sign In” button and sign in with your Google account.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the “New Notebook” button to create a new notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the “+” button to add a new code cell.</p></li>
<li><p>Type the following code in the cell and run it:</p></li>
<li><p>The output should look like this:</p></li>

<p>ok – can you set an assessment for policy makers to interpret the data and mitigate this problems . we are executives with UNICEF in west Africa. lets ask three questions to describe the different communities (the scenarios capture – interpret what they see in the graph). the first one interprets the data. the second question : what will be the solution to the problem analyzed including policy solutions. and the third, anticipated challenges to proposed solutions</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Certainly! Below are three questions that can guide the assessment and policy planning around the data visualized in the scatter plot, keeping in context that the audience is UNICEF executives focusing on West Africa:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Interpretation of Data:</strong></p>

<p>can you produce an answerkey ? thanks!</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Certainly! Below are some suggested answers for the questions based on the provided code and the context of the problem. Please note that these answers are speculative and are based on the simulated data and the general principles that might apply to these scenarios. Real-world data and expert insights would be necessary for a comprehensive understanding.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Interpretation of Data:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The scatter plot illustrates the inequitable distribution of teachers in Uganda, Botswana, and Kenya, concerning the distance from urban areas. Uganda appears to have the most equitable distribution, as the decrease in the number of teachers as the distance from urban areas increases is more gradual. In contrast, Kenya shows the steepest decline, indicating a significant disparity in teacher distribution, followed by Botswana. The variations in the slopes suggest different levels of access to education between urban and remote areas in these countries, with Uganda having better access and Kenya the least.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Solutions and Policy Proposals:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The underlying causes of these disparities may include lack of infrastructure, limited incentives for teachers to work in remote areas, and unequal funding. Solutions could include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Uganda:</strong> Further improving infrastructure and incentives for teachers in more distant areas, considering the relatively good equity already in place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Botswana:</strong> Implementing targeted recruitment and retention strategies, along with investments in rural education facilities and teacher training.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kenya:</strong> Enacting robust policies to redistribute educational resources more fairly, including incentives for teachers to work in rural areas, transportation support, and increased funding for remote schools.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>All Countries:</strong> Collaboration with local communities, NGOs, and international organizations to develop tailored solutions and ensure sustainability.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Anticipated Challenges to Proposed Solutions:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Potential challenges might include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Political Resistance:</strong> Policymakers in urban areas might resist redistributing resources to rural regions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Funding Constraints:</strong> Implementing these solutions could be expensive, and securing sufficient funding might be challenging.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Ensuring local community buy-in for new policies or changes may require significant effort.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infrastructure Limitations:</strong> In remote areas, lack of basic infrastructure may hinder the implementation of new educational strategies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring and Evaluation:</strong> Continuous assessment of the policies to ensure that they are effectively addressing the inequity could be complex.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Engaging stakeholders early in the process, creating targeted communication strategies, and developing comprehensive implementation plans could help address these challenges.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <summary>5. Skills</summary>
<p>Challenges, skills, and tools: this essential summary of the human condition finds very specific resonance with education psychology. The challenges of the 21st century are not just about the skills and tools, but also about the mindset and the ability to adapt.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Paper</strong>
The ability to adapt is a skill that can be taught – should be the focus in the post ChatGPT world. The mindset is a challenge that can be overcome – the mindset that education is about adding content to a students memory. The tools and skills are the easiest to teach (essentially, being comfortable chatting with an AI chatbot like ChatGPT).</p>
<p>So, how do we teach the mindset and the ability to adapt? These are the questions that we need to answer. And we need to answer them fast.</p>
<p>Inspired by our 2 hour discussion about GitHub, ChatGPT, Google Colab, and Education Psychology, we have decided to restructure the insights emerging from the discussion into a more coherent and structured format. We will be using the following format:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The challenge that we are trying to solve.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Skills:</strong> The skills that are required to solve the challenge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tools:</strong> The tools that can be used to solve the challenge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solutions:</strong> The solutions that can be used to solve the challenge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The assessment strategies that can be used to assess the solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feedback:</strong> The feedback strategies that can be used to provide feedback on the solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resources:</strong> The resources that can be used to learn more about the challenge, skills, tools, solutions, assessment, and feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The conclusion that summarizes the challenge, skills, tools, solutions, assessment, feedback, and resources.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>5.3 Academic origins</strong></p>
<p>The concept of the plot is inspired by the theory of “flow,” a term in positive psychology. The term “<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(psychology)">flow</a>” was coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a psychologist who has been a prominent researcher in the field.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Flow-boredom-and-anxiety-as-they-relate-to-task-challenge-and-a-persons-skills_fig1_330507488">Flow</a> represents a state of complete immersion and engagement in an activity, where an individual’s skill level and the challenge level of the task are perfectly balanced. According to Csikszentmihalyi, flow occurs when a person’s abilities are fully involved in overcoming a challenge that is just about manageable.</p>
<p>In the context of flow, the different regions you’ve plotted correspond to different psychological states:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Anxiety Area (Red): Where the challenge exceeds the skill. This imbalance can lead to frustration and anxiety.</p></li>
<li><p>Boredom Area (Green): Where the skill exceeds the challenge. This can lead to disengagement or boredom.</p></li>
<li><p>Yellow Zone (Flow Channel): Where the skill and challenge are balanced. This is the zone where flow happens, and it’s often depicted as a channel or curve where the relationship between challenge and skill is matched.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your use of sinusoidal functions to plot these regions provides an artistic representation of these concepts, capturing the continuous and fluid nature of the relationship between skill and challenge in the human experience. It’s an interesting visualization that could serve to illustrate the dynamic nature of flow and the balance between different psychological states.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This is a great start! I like the idea of using a sinusoidal function to represent the relationship between skill and challenge. It’s a creative way to visualize the concept of flow and the balance between different psychological states. I think it would be interesting to see how this visualization could be applied to other areas, such as education or business. It would also be interesting to see how this visualization could be used to represent the relationship between different psychological states, such as anxiety and boredom. Overall, I think this is a great start and I look forward to seeing how this visualization could be applied to other areas. – <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">copilot</span> <span class="pre">interjected</span></code></p>

<p><strong>Dad’s Feedback</strong>:</p>
<p>We may share our paper and even invite daddy as coauthor. Perhaps this experience will spur him to write his own papers, books, and articles on education psychology, sociology, social work, and other topics that he is passionate about.</p>
<p>Bypassing the traditional publication houses and going straight to the readers is the future of publishing. We might ocassicanally need peer review but that shouldn’t hold us back from publishing our own work as this very resource is a testament to.</p>
<p>Text, audio, and video can be embedded at different points of the book. Content can be updated. The URL is easy to share with a wide range of the target audience, at essentially zero cost.</p>

  <summary>6. Verdict</summary>
<p>Let’s move forward with the paper and utilize all the tools and resources we’ve discussed today. We can continue to refine the paper iteratively, incorporating feedback from others and our own reflections. We can also continue to explore the tools and resources we’ve discussed, including GitHub, ChatGPT, Google Colab, and others. This is just the beginning of our journey, and we have a lot to learn and explore together. Let’s keep the conversation going! - <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">copilot</span> <span class="pre">interjected</span></code></p>
