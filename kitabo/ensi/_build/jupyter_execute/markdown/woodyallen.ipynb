    "### Flawed 1, 2, 3\n",
    "The phrase \"bumbling neurotic\" immediately brings to mind the iconic characters created by Woody Allen. His characters often embody a mix of clumsy, awkward behavior with an incessant, often humorous neurosis. Films like \"Annie Hall\" and \"Manhattan\" showcase this archetype perfectly. These characters are endearingly flawed, overthinking everything, and often finding themselves in comically uncomfortable situations. Allen's portrayal of these characters has become a hallmark of his filmography, creating a distinct, relatable, and memorable persona in cinema. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is George Costanza from \"Seinfeld,\" who epitomizes the bumbling neurotic. His constant anxiety, overreactions, and ill-fated schemes make him a classic example of this trope. The beauty of these characters lies in their ability to make the audience laugh while reflecting on their own insecurities and idiosyncrasies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Endearingly 4\n",
    "Woody Allen's characters are a masterclass in being \"endearingly flawed.\" They stumble through life with a blend of self-awareness and haplessness that makes them both relatable and endearing. Their neurotic quirks and constant self-doubt often lead to moments of profound insight and humor. This combination of vulnerability and wit is what makes Allen's characters stand out. They remind us that it's okay to be imperfect and that sometimes our greatest flaws can also be our most charming attributes. In a world that often values perfection, these characters offer a refreshing, human perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bumbling Incompetent 5, 6\n",
    "Personally, Ethan Coen's bumbling incompetents, from Raising Arizona, via the Dude, to all the men in Drive-Away Dolls, helped me unconver this `archetypal` schlemiel. This has renewed my fading interest in Woody Allen. By contrast, Tarantino's characters are mostly extremely competent, but all-too-human nonetheless.\n",
