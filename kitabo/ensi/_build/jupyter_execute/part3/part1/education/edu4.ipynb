    "Dear Kadi, my quick look through gets me excited indeed! I think the last part(#5) is actually the beginning of the paper. Once we have agreed on how to engage AI as part of #2); then the rest are illustrative or examples of how to proceed. I will look some more and get back on chronology of our discussion. I like the idea of a tripartite authorship as a practical way of getting Muzei started on his own writing. Cheers     \n",

    "First, [I](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/technology/how-schools-can-survive-and-maybe-even-thrive-with-ai-this-fall.html) encourage educators — especially those who teach in high schools and colleges — to assume that 100 percent of their students are using ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools on every assignment, in every subject, unless they’re being physically supervised inside a school building\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, schools should stop relying on A.I. detector programs to catch students cheating (sounds like an ill-conceived adversarial game)\n",
    "\n",
    "My third piece of advice — and the one that may get me the most angry emails from teachers — is that teachers should focus less on warning students about the shortcomings of generative A.I. than figuring out what the technology does well.\n",

    "1. Dimentionality reduction (or the Univariable model that fits better than all Multivariable models)\n",
    "- driving force behind the most important algorithms in machine learning and data science: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, autoencoders, and more\n",
    "- but also a projection of the creators' human minds and thus the foundation of all human learning and intelligence (e.g., language, vision, motor control, etc.)\n",
    "- if all of the above is true, then dimensionality reduction is the most important concept in all of data science and machine learning (and perhaps all of science) \n",
    "- since life is a series and challenges both big and small, it quickly becomes apparent that dimensionality reduction is the most important concept in all of life. life becomes chaotic and unmanageable if all events are viewed as independent \n",
    "- a most celebrated skill or tool in life is the ability to see the big picture and connect the dots. this is the essence of dimensionality reduction. why else is the iphone such a success? it reduces the dimensionality of life by connecting the dots of communication, entertainment, and productivity. and why is chatGPT the most revolutionary tool in the history of education? it reduces the dimensionality of learning by connecting the dots of knowledge, creativity, and communication. all can now be found in one place and in one tool (a single dimension).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables (i.e., principal components) that account for most of the variance in the original data set (i.e., the data with a high number of dimensions)\n",
    "\n",
    "- when multivariable regressions are fit to data, the \"fit\" of the model to the data might be celebrated\n",
    "- but almost immediately concerns about overfitting arise and whether this model will generalize to new data\n",
    "- soon parsimony becomes a virtue and the model is reduced to a few variables. this is dimensionality reduction\n",
    "- therefore all didacting tools in life are dimensionality reduction tools. they reduce the dimensionality of life by connecting the dots of knowledge, creativity, and communication. all can now be found in one place and in one tool (a single dimension). \n",
    "- monotheistic religions of the world are generations on generations of dimentionality reduction down to a single dimension (e.g., one god, one book, one prophet, one savior, one path, one truth, one life, one way, one love, one ethos). the greeks of antiquity remain a special caze with their unseemingly infinite gods and goddesses. but even they had a pantheon of gods and goddesses that were reduced to a single dimension (e.g., zeus, hera, athena, apollo, etc.). and in that pantheon a hierarchy -- like all hierarchies -- with zeus at the top comes to the same thing as monotheistic religions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Education can thus be seen as providing a mechanism by which students recognize peers who are more capable than themselves, and then imitate them. Or approaches to challenges that utilize the fewest number of dimensions (i.e., the most parsimonious approach) are the most successful and emulate them\n",
    "\n",
    "- chatGPT seems to be that thing. Unlike a Google search query that returns a list of ranked links, chatGPT returns a single answer to offer the most parsimonious approach to learning.\n",
    "- this brings with it as much danger as a religion with zealots who have a single answer to all questions and never question the answer.\n",
    "- it is in this spirit that educators should embrace chatGPT and teach students to question the answers and answers to the questions.\n",
    "- by using AI to manage actual projects who success speaks for itself, educators can teach students to question the answers and answers to the questions. \n",
    "- As a medical doctor who woke up one day and started writing code, I can attest to the power of this approach. I have learned more in the past 2 months about the capabilities of my Mac than I did in the previous 20 years of my life. And I have done so by getting Unix, Bash, Python code from chatGPT for extremely specific tasks (such as setting up a workflow involving .ipynb and ulimately ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html). the errors in the code given by chatGPT have reflected sloppiness in my requests, and at times the limit of chatGPT. take-away this feedback system in the US of AI, and you can possibly produce a generation of zealots who never question the answers and answers to the questions.\n",
