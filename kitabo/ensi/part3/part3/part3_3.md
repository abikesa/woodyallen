**_Embracing More Remote Overtones of the Harmonic Series_**. The hunter-gatherer relies on their `senses` to decide when to go hunting and gathering. It's all about hunger. But if `memory` of hardships serves you right, as population growth and competition for niches and land emerge, then sowing seeds and bringing in the sheaves becomes a communal obligation. Over time competitive pressures will lead to wars, slaves, and the conversion of man to tool. This encodes a critical, `emotional`, unforgettable aspect of human history. Soon, the very essence of farming becomes codified and made programmable so that autonomous and `intelligent` machines of an industrial revolution take over these ancient processes. This is _The Matrix_. With humans being displaced from manual labor, with their alienation from their species essence, there emerges a new use for them: as a source of critical energy in a world that hungers for "compute". This is the `capital` of the _OpenAI_ generation. And so the stage is set for the _School of Resentment_ to wax lyrical about the ascendancy of AI and its `deployment` to every corner of the world, in every imaginable industry, and the ethics of it all. This is the world of 2024 and beyond.

**_Friendship, Character, Ethics_**. The opening dialogue in [Millers Crossing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQ940YSD2A) has held my interest for a decade. If you can't trust a [fix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLpbh5d3Hhg), then what can you trust? Chance? Anarchy? This is what seperates us from the beasts.
