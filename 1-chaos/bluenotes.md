1. The best proof of the `construct validity` of the harmonic series is its ability to subsume virtually every topic I've encountered on music over 43 years
2. So we know the WTC is an approximation of this series and in no way reflects anything "innate" as Chomsky and Berstein insist upon
3. It is in these `blue notes` that we find the African American trying to recapture the 4th "unique" note in the series that WTC departs from
   - We also see it alot in the b5th interval that dominates black music
