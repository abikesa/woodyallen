So basically, the [harmonic series](https://www.reddit.com/user/phearsom_fysic/) was discovered by Pythagoras (that's right, the math guy) when he walked past a blacksmith and heard that a bit of metal being hit gave more than one tone (so the story goes). He then devised a ratio (he used string lengths) that would get you the same sound just... higher (what we call an octave). This ratio is 2:1; or for every time one string vibrates once, another vibrates twice. The other basic ratios are 3:2, (one string vibrating thrice while the other vibrates twice), giving you a perfect fifth; and 4:3, giving you a perfect fourth. These perfect intervals (except for the octave) are no longer used today however thanks to equal temperament, but they sound absolutely 100% pure.

The first widely used tuning was the Pythagorean tuning, which stacked the 3:2 ratios (ie perfect fifth intervals) on top of each other. If you start with C you get the following.

`C - G - D - A - E - B`

But, you know what, B sounds close enough to C (what we now call a minor second, but slightly off). So why don't we just make it a C, move all the notes into the same octave, and call it a pentatonic scale. Easy!

`C - D - E - G - A - C`

But wait, theres more. What if we keep stacking up.

`C - G - D - A - E - B - F#(Gb) - C#(Db)`

If we stop there and just flatten the last two a little bit. We get the diatonic scale.

`C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C`

But wait, there's even more! What if we keep going?

`C - G - D - A - E - B - F#(Gb) - C#(Db) - G#(Ab) - D#(Eb) - A#(Bb) - F - C`

Wow, we just made all the notes. Well, the top C is a little off, but we can just contract it (by 24 cents, called the Pythagorean comma) and it's pretty much perfect. The only problem with Pythagorean tuning is trying to move to different keys on the one instrument. If you change key without retuning your harpsichord, that Pythagorean comma is going to pop up in a different place of every scale. Not fun.

A bunch of other temperaments and tunings were developed over time. Some had huge gaps (called wolf tones) between two of the notes to maintain an octave that sounded disgusting, others compromised their pure fifths in favour of pure thirds, which became the new basis for harmony in the 15th century.

Eventually, Vincenzo Galilei, father of the famous Galileo, came along and said "why don't we just make it super duper easy?". Thus, equal temperament was born. Although, everything was fucked. Fifths were tuned flat, thirds were tuned sharp. Everything just sounded wrong. But hey, it was easy. And we could transpose between keys without having to retune. And it's been used ever since until, today, it sounds like the most normal thing in the world.

tl;dr: The pentatonic, diatonic, and chromatic scales were all built by stacking up perfect (like, 3:2 ratio perfect) fifths until we got more or less back to where we started.

And, equal temperament ruined harmony, but made it really easy to play with a bunch of other people.
