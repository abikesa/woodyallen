The history of British, Roman, Viking, and Middle Eastern interactions involves a complex web of invasions, colonization, and statecraft that spans centuries. Here's a brief outline that encapsulates the points you mentioned:

1. **Romans & Vikings:** Britain was subjected to invasions and settlements by both Romans and Vikings. The Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD, establishing Roman rule which lasted for approximately 400 years. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Vikings, from Scandinavia, began raids in the late 8th century, eventually settling and intermingling with the local population in various parts of Britain.

2. **End of Passivity:** Over time, the inhabitants of Britain, including the Anglo-Saxons, who were themselves invaders that settled in Britain during and after the Roman era, began to assert their own identity and sovereignty. This was not an instantaneous process but developed over a period of centuries, particularly after the Norman Conquest in 1066 which brought a new dynasty to the throne of England. By the late Middle Ages, Britain had begun to extend its own influence and control beyond its borders through exploration, trade, and later, colonization.

3. **Agents Doing Unto Others:** The British Empire expanded to become one of the largest empires in history. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it had control over large parts of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and the Pacific. This was often to the detriment of indigenous populations and involved exploitation, imposition of British culture, and economic dominance.

4. **Israel Gained Agency:** The modern state of Israel was established in part due to British involvement in the region. After World War I, Britain gained control of Palestine through a mandate from the League of Nations. The Balfour Declaration of 1917 indicated British support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, which laid groundwork for later statehood. However, the path to establishing Israel was marked by complex international politics and conflict.

5. **Palestinians Lost Agency:** The establishment of Israel in 1948 and the subsequent Arab-Israeli conflicts led to large numbers of Palestinians becoming refugees and to the enduring Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinians lost their homes and much of their land, leading to ongoing disputes and negotiations over statehood, sovereignty, and rights.

Each of these points represents a vast subject with many perspectives and interpretations. Historians and political scientists often analyze these events through various lenses, considering the broad sweep of social, economic, political, and military factors that shaped them.
