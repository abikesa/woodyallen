I believe I can fly :-)      
At least in my dreams    
`Third` time Iâ€™ve had this dream (NIA Grant: Score: 47 -> 23?)   
But details vary somewhat   
First time there were witnesses

`Fourth` time! (Slept on [this](https://github.com/abikesa/dialygrind) at 2:07 AM)

   - Now [this](https://mailchi.mp/nih.gov/januarayomnibus-53728?e=9af795b4c2) (preview below)
   - Personalized medicine:: the Hopkins initiative
   - Setup the infrastructure for PMAP and apply to Frailty
   - Bring together chemistry, psychology, and sociology of frailty from EMR and compete with NHATS
   - And this is the idea of a small NIA business: market it across Hopkins then beyond!!!

`Fifith` time!

- This time I wasn't doing a "Superman": rather, I was doing flips in perhaps an F15, not sure which jet!
- Perhaps the Ubermensch has got extra wings in AI?

PHS 2023-2 Omnibus Solicitation for Small Business Funding & Commercial Readiness Pilot Program Opportunities Now Available
Apply now for funding to commercialize your innovation
The Small Business Programs at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) offer early-stage funding opportunities to small businesses and researchers looking to commercialize innovative treatments or technologies to help people enjoy healthier lives as they age. The NIA is accepting applications for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding. Learn more about these open opportunities. The next deadline to apply is January 5, 2024, unless otherwise noted. 
Current Funding Opportunities

Everyone should consider submitting an application through the Omnibus Solicitation, which covers a broad range of NIA research topics and investigator-initiated ideas. For topics listed in the SBA-Approved Waiver Topics, the budget limits have increased for 2023: The limit for Phase I applications is now $400,000 in total costs or project periods exceeding two years and the limit for Phase II applications is now $2.25 million in total costs or project periods exceeding three years. The limit for Phase IIB remains $3 million.

For small businesses and research organizations working on solutions for Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), NIA has targeted solicitations for SBIR and STTR that allow for higher budget limits of up to $500,000 for Phase I and $2.5 million for Phase II. These opportunities are part of NIAâ€™s unprecedented research and development budget to develop AD/ADRD interventions and therapeutics.

- In context of dreams `#2 & #3` above there is a them of **FACE**: bird-like freedom, high altitude, utter contempt, overflowing exuberance
- From the perspective of `#4`, I've successfully laid down the technical infrastructure for quick deployment of sophisticated WebApps for personalized medicine
- With the Vince (Hopkins) & Jing (CDC) email thread suggesting that I'll have `e(b), V(b)` and `stcox ... , basesurv(s0)` before end of week
- Zeyi's just returned to Uganda after SPJD pulled off a whirlwind tour of Brussels, Viginia, DD, Maryland, Detroit, California, Utah, Delaware, Pennsylvannia, New Jersey, New York, Bujumbura
- Now my focus is exclusively Thesis, Grants, and some sort of plan for 2025
