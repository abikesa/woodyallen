### Biological: Connecting Dots  1, 2, 3
- Hungry. Your senses should guide you in the midst of the chaos of life. Life isn't deterministic. Can't connect dots forward. Caligraphy class in Reed College didn't promise me anything.
- Foolish. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is the results of other people's thinking
- Love. Have the courage to follow your intuition, interpreted by love. When I was fired from Apple, the heaviness of being successful was replaced with the freedom of being a beginner again. And this led me to NexT, Pixar, Toy Story, and my wife! Your work and craft will take more of your time than anything else in your life. So it must be guided by love

### Social: Greatness  4
- Restless. So do great work, don’t settle. You’ll know when you find it. Keep looking until you can "Sing O Muse!"

### Personal: Dogma-Free 5, 6 
- Death. Remembering that I’ll be dead soon made me live each day like it was the last. 
- Intuitions. Gave me the courage to follow my` intuition. Everything else is secondary. Stay hungry, stay foolish.
