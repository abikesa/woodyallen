1. [Metaphysical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-w_n9NJIE)
   - Brain: inspiration
   - [Progress](https://github.com/abikesa/greeks/blob/main/README.md): we don't need it anymore
      - Yuval Noah Harari says `we have no clue what to teach our kids anymore, since we have no clue what skills will be needed in 20y`
      - This is perhaps the first time in history that its been the case!! 
3. [Identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckz8XA2hW84)
   - Does anyone know that AI is all about learning?
   - All about machine learning?
   - Machines do not have biologically constrained `neural networks`
   - So if you have "unlimited" money to spend on "compute" you can build unlimited intelligence
   - Of course you'll need sufficiently large data or or estensive simulation or selfplay to achieve that
   - Isn't this a helpful way to gain insights into our childrens `education`
   - Regardless, their education is going to be limited compared with AGI
   - Jensen Huang states that Ilya had the insight that GPU would be sufficient to train a neural network
   - Thats how their paths crossed:
      - 2002: Neuronetworks
        - Useful construct with validity in human brain
      - 2012: Alexnet
        - Testing it with Jensens hardware
      - 2022: ChatGPT
        - Microsoft's Azure is the `compute` dimension of the picture
4. Epistemology
   - How do children get to learn about the world they'll inhabit and shape?
   - Formal `education`
   - And increasingly [social media](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/11/04/do-social-media-threaten-democracy)
   - But AI is already dominating the quantity of information in social media
   - So its already here whether we like it or not
   - Segue: Actors, on strike since July 14, are likewise seeking better compensation from streaming. But they are also demanding [safeguards against AI](https://apnews.com/article/hollywood-ai-strike-wga-artificial-intelligence-39ab72582c3a15f77510c9c30a45ffc8), which can potentially use a starâ€™s likeness without his or her permission or replace background actors entirely.
   - Might teachers face similar existential [concerns](https://github.com/abikesa/language/blob/main/README.md)?
   - Isn't all this acknowledgment of the power of AI?
   - What exactly are the ethics of copyright and patents?
   - Didn't pharmaceutics make exemptions of HIV/AIDS drugs?
   - Exemptions for low income countries leading to PEPFAR?

   Can't we use this narrative for AI and education in low income countries:
   - Clearly ChatGPT is powerful enough to make professional afraid of competition
   - But if we suppose the ethics of copyright to the data on which ChatGPT are addressed:
   - Then can't we by analogy go ahead with a PEPFAR equivalent for education:
   - Making ChatGPT and other AI supported application accesible?
   - Especially in settings beset by a student: teacher ratio > XX?

   Which brings us to the main issue:
   - Truth?
        - When viewed as just one dimension of the full picture it looses all its charm
        - Is there any point in knowing one truth when there are 1 billion truths in the natural and physical world?
        - Should we restrict oursleves to the truths that matter to us?>
        - How are we to classify truths into useful and not without knowing them?
        - You get the picture!
   - $\text{Knowledge}=\alpha+\text{X}\beta+\epsilon$?
        - $\alpha=\text{Truth}$
        - $\text{X}\beta+\epsilon=\text{Error}$
          - $\text{X}\beta=\text{Bias}$
            - Known-Known
          - $\epsilon=\text{Variance}$
            - Known-Unknown
            - Unknown-Unknown
   - Ethics?
     - AI will increase all these moieties of knowledge
     - Expentially so and already doing so
     - Finding the wheat in the Chuff!
     - That is education; more challenging than ever before
   - What is the purpose of education?
   - For settings with high student: teacher ratio AI serves an `empowering`, ethical end
5. Ontology
   - The foundation of early education is reading, writing, and rithmetic, the `3Rs`
   - Whether its reading or writing the following issues from large language models like ChatGPT emerge:
     - Phonology
       - ChatGPT is able to transcribe your voice and produce shocking accurate text
       - Various deep fakes have produced compelling audio-video impersonation of public figures
     - Syntax
       - But the greatest achievement of LLMs is with syntax
       - Here AI bots produce smoother sounding langauge than virtually any human
     - Meaning
       - Our concern however is with semantics
       - How to capture the essence of a communication in language must relate to the `Will` of speaker
       - Essentially meaning and agency are inseperable because intentionality is key even when there is miscommunication
       - AGI will be the only version of AI that acts as if it had a Will of its own and intensions of its own
       - Navigating minutae of detail today in light of a long term task: thats AGI
       - So we should expect the issue of semantics to fully arrive only then
       - But, with no pun intended, what exactly does ASI like ChatGPT mean for education right now?
         1. That it should brace itself of AGI
         2. Perhaps even ASI may give an edge to those who use it over those who do not
         3. Smooth sounding, compelling text and essays may completely lack content and accurate meaning
         4. In other words, the work for students, teachers, and the whole world dealing with fake or deep-fake just got harder
         5. `Being oblevious to the workings of AI might be the single most dangerous this in the world we are getting into and preparing for todays children`

     - Environment for self-play + reinforcement learning (both from success & failure) = high learning rate
     - Dexterity and other skills acquired through self-play may generalize to the real-world
     - And herein lies the foundation for AGI

   - `Meaning`:: which according to Foucault is simple: everything in society, hierarchical in nature, is shaped by power
     - The geopolitics driving AI are thus important: every country is pushing to lead and find an edge over its competitors and the world-order is thus threatened
     - Europes disposition to `Regulate`, Americas to `Innovate`, and Chinas to `Produce` (think Huawei vs. Nvidia and Computer hardware 2.0) are irrelevant in light of geopolitics
     - Anyone who is not leading in hardware (computer 2.0) and software (AGI) because they are "concerned" about the dangers of AI will be the first victim
     - "I told you so" will be no consolation to them; here its Europe that we have in mind
     - But Russia will accelerate its work if the Western World concerns itself with Regulation

   - Proverbs 27:12
