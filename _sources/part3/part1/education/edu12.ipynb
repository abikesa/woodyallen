    "Ethics of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone who views AI ethics as a prerequisite for AI deployment into the education curriculum for 8-15 year olds must understand that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- its perhaps unethical to squander limited resources on teaching students what they will not need to memorize or use in their future careers\n",
    "- unless time and money is unlimited, there is a tradeoff between teaching AI ethics and teaching other subjects\n",
    "- the best protection against AI ethics violations is to teach students how to code and how to build AI systems; basically to engineer solutions to problems (including for those ethicists who view AI as a problem to be regulated)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not focus on real-world problems right away? They don't have to be AI related. Just good old fashioned real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- enumerate some top problems in the world today\n",
    "- let students pick one or more problems to work on\n",
    "- maybe they can work in teams\n",
    "- cluster randomize to use-ai or not-use-ai\n",
    "- follow up for efficacy and adverse effects\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is a simple experiment that can be done in a few months. It can be done in a few weeks if the problems are simple enough. **It can be done in a few days if the problems are simple enough** and the students are motivated enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas you present here touch on an interesting dilemma in the modern educational landscape: what is the right balance between technical education and the teaching of ethical considerations? This is a particularly salient issue in the age of AI and rapid technological advances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Balancing Technical and Ethical Education\n",
    "\n",
    "You make a point that teaching students how to code and build AI systems could, in itself, be a form of protection against ethical violations in AI. The implication here is that a strong understanding of the technology may offer insights into its limitations and potential for misuse, thereby equipping students to make ethical choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, knowing how to build a system isn't the same as understanding its societal impact. While technical knowledge is crucial, the humanities and social sciences contribute valuable perspectives on the ethical, cultural, and social dimensions of technology. In that light, a balanced approach might be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Experimental Approach to Teaching\n",
    "\n",
    "Your proposed experimental design for education focuses on practical, real-world problems. This is a solid idea for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immediate Relevance**: Students are more likely to be engaged when they see the direct applicability of what they are learning.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Interdisciplinary Learning**: Real-world problems are complex and usually require an interdisciplinary approach. This can be a great way to integrate various subjects and skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Autonomy and Teamwork**: Allowing students to pick their own problems and work in teams promotes autonomy and collaboration, skills crucial for the 21st century.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analytical Thinking**: The experimental setup you suggest would give students a firsthand understanding of empirical research methods, including study design, data collection, and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **AI-Integration**: Randomizing groups to use AI or not gives students an understanding of when AI can be a useful tool and when it may not add value.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Risk Assessment**: Monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects offers a lesson in risk-benefit analysis, which is applicable in many fields beyond AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Language and Style Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "As for refining language and style, the text is already quite clear. If you want to make it more formal or academic, you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce each section with a clear thesis statement.\n",
    "- Use more academic vocabulary where appropriate.\n",
    "- Provide citations or references to support your arguments.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Overall, your ideas offer an interesting blend of practical skills and academic knowledge, with an emphasis on quick, real-world application. It's an approach that could yield useful data on the efficacy of various teaching methods, and potentially lead to more targeted, effective education."
